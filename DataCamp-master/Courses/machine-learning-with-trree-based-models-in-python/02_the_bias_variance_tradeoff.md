## [The Bias-Variance Tradeoff](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/machine-learning-with-tree-based-models-in-python/the-bias-variance-tradeoff)

The bias-variance tradeoff is one of the fundamental concepts in supervised machine learning. In this chapter, you'll understand how to diagnose the problems of overfitting and underfitting. You'll also be introduced to the concept of ensembling where the predictions of several models are aggregated to produce predictions that are more robust.
