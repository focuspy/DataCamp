## Introduction and flat files

In this chapter, you'll learn how to import data into Python from all types of flat files, which are a simple and prevalent form of data storage. You've previously learned how to use NumPy and pandasâ€”you will learn how to use these packages to import flat files and customize your imports.

### [Exploring your working directory](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-importing-data-in-python/introduction-and-flat-files-1?ex=2)

```
Q: which of the following files is in your working directory?
A: moby_dick.txt
```

### [Importing entire text files](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-importing-data-in-python/introduction-and-flat-files-1?ex=3)

```
# Open a file: file
file = open("moby_dick.txt", "r")

# Print it
print(file.read())

# Check whether file is closed
print(file.closed)

# Close file
file.close()

# Check whether file is closed
print(file.closed)
```

### [Importing text files line by line](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-importing-data-in-python/introduction-and-flat-files-1?ex=4)

```
# Read & print the first 3 lines
with open('moby_dick.txt') as file:
    print(file.readline())
    print(file.readline())
    print(file.readline())
```

### [Pop quiz: examples of flat files](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-importing-data-in-python/introduction-and-flat-files-1?ex=6)

```
Q: Which of these file types below is NOT an example of a flat file?
A: A .csv file.
```

### [Pop quiz: what exactly are flat files?](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-importing-data-in-python/introduction-and-flat-files-1?ex=7)

```
Q: Which of the following statements about flat files is incorrect?
A: Flat files consist of rows and each row is called a record.
```

### [Why we like flat files and the Zen of Python](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-importing-data-in-python/introduction-and-flat-files-1?ex=8)

```
Q: The question you need to answer is: what is the 5th aphorism of the Zen of Python?
A: Flat is better than nested.
```

### [Using NumPy to import flat files](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-importing-data-in-python/introduction-and-flat-files-1?ex=10)

```
# Import package
import numpy as np

# Assign filename to variable: file
file = 'digits.csv'

# Load file as array: digits
digits = np.loadtxt(file, delimiter=',')

# Print datatype of digits
print(type(digits))

# Select and reshape a row
im = digits[21, 1:]
im_sq = np.reshape(im, (28, 28))

# Plot reshaped data (matplotlib.pyplot already loaded as plt)
plt.imshow(im_sq, cmap='Greys', interpolation='nearest')
plt.show()
```

### [Customizing your NumPy import](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-importing-data-in-python/introduction-and-flat-files-1?ex=11)

```
# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Assign the filename: file
file = 'digits_header.txt'

# Load the data: data
data = np.loadtxt(file, delimiter='\t', skiprows=1, usecols=[0,2])

# Print data
print(data)
```

### [Importing different datatypes (1)](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-importing-data-in-python/introduction-and-flat-files-1?ex=12)

```
Q: After importing the Titanic data as a structured array (as per the instructions above), print the entire column with the name Survived to the shell. What are the last 4 values of this column?
A: 1,0,1,0.
```

### [Working with mixed datatypes (2)](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-importing-data-in-python/introduction-and-flat-files-1?ex=14)

```
# Assign the filename: file
file = 'titanic.csv'

# Import file using np.recfromcsv: d
d = np.recfromcsv(file, delimiter=',', names=True, dtype=None)

# Print out first three entries of d
print(d[:3])
```

### [Using pandas to import flat files as DataFrames (1)](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-importing-data-in-python/introduction-and-flat-files-1?ex=16)

```
# Import pandas as pd
import pandas as pd

# Assign the filename: file
file = 'titanic.csv'

# Read the file into a DataFrame: df
df = pd.read_csv(file)

# View the head of the DataFrame
print(df.head())
```

### [Using pandas to import flat files as DataFrames (2)](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-importing-data-in-python/introduction-and-flat-files-1?ex=17)

```
# Assign the filename: file
file = 'digits.csv'

# Read the first 5 rows of the file into a DataFrame: data
data = pd.read_csv(file, nrows=5, header=None)

# Build a numpy array from the DataFrame: data_array
data_array = np.array(data)

# Print the datatype of data_array to the shell
print(type(data_array))
```

### [Customizing your pandas import](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-importing-data-in-python/introduction-and-flat-files-1?ex=18)

```
# Import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assign filename: file
file = 'titanic_corrupt.txt'

# Import file: data
data = pd.read_csv(file, sep='\t', comment='#', na_values='Nothing')

# Print the head of the DataFrame
print(data.head())

# Plot 'Age' variable in a histogram
pd.DataFrame.hist(data[['Age']])
plt.xlabel('Age (years)')
plt.ylabel('count')
plt.show()
```
