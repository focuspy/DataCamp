1,cv103,11021,4,my reasons for this are simple : 1 ) adam sandler is great .,pos
1,cv103,11021,5,2 ) drew barrymore is great .,pos
1,cv103,11021,6,3 ) the movie is so funny .,pos
1,cv103,11021,7,there are parts that left me gasping for air because i was laughing so hard .,pos
1,cv103,11021,8,i haven't laughed this hard in a movie since austin powers .,pos
1,cv103,11021,9,"sandler plays robby hart , a wedding singer who once had dreams of being in a rock band and writing his own music .",pos
1,cv103,11021,10,"in the opening scenes , he seems like a happy-go-lucky wedding singer , at least partially enjoying his profession and doing a rather good job of talking down a really drunk individual ( steve buscemi ) who decides that his brother's wedding is a good place to tell the whole world that his life , up to that point , was utter pointlessness .",pos
1,cv103,11021,11,"a week later , at his own wedding , he is left standing at the altar by his ex-fianc ? e , linda ( angela featherstone ) .",pos
1,cv103,11021,12,"with his life in complete disarray , he meets julia ( barrymore ) , a waitress .",pos
1,cv103,11021,13,"she is engaged to glenn ( matthew glave ) , and is to marry him in about three months .",pos
1,cv103,11021,14,julia and robby become good friends when she enlists him to help with the wedding plans .,pos
1,cv103,11021,15,"soon ( and predictably ) it becomes pretty clear that glenn is a jerk , and that robby and julia really love each other .",pos
1,cv103,11021,16,"oh sure , it's trite .",pos
1,cv103,11021,17,"and if anyone making this film expected us to , like , feel suspense or something while watching the wedding singer , then they truly underestimated their audience .",pos
1,cv103,11021,18,"what makes the story bearable , aside from the terrific costumes and 80s music , are the performances .",pos
1,cv103,11021,19,barrymore is simply adorable here ( i've never seen her look so close to the way she did in et ) .,pos
1,cv103,11021,20,"not only is she pleasant to look at , but her acting job here really is a good one--and it doesn't hurt that the character is likable and adequately well-written .",pos
1,cv103,11021,21,"and the jerk , played in full-force by graves , is just as despicable as any villain in any romantic comedy i've ever seen .",pos
1,cv103,11021,22,"naturally , the true star here is sandler .",pos
1,cv103,11021,23,i think the guy is flat-out hilarious .,pos
1,cv103,11021,24,"he can say something that just isn't funny , and his delivery makes me laugh .",pos
1,cv103,11021,25,"his comedic performance here equals that of happy gilmore , but in this film he goes much further and proves to me that he can , indeed , hold his own as a leading man in a romantic comedy .",pos
1,cv103,11021,26,"whereas his roles in his previous films kind of had sandler playing sandler , the wedding singer gives him a character that , for the first time , he actually has to fit into .",pos
1,cv103,11021,27,"as far as i'm concerned he succeeded , and this film is testimony that he does , in fact , have some range in his talents .",pos
1,cv103,11021,28,and the movie is just so funny .,pos
1,cv103,11021,29,perhaps the best moment is when he sings a song for julia that he claims is a little uneven because he began writing it while in a good mood and finished it after his fianc ? e abandoned him .,pos
1,cv103,11021,30,this is the part that literally had me groping for a breath of air .,pos
1,cv103,11021,31,"and while the film , like all romantic comedies , takes a hiatus from laughs towards the end because the plot has to finish up , there are more than enough truly hilarious moments in the first hour that make up for any slumps in progress during the second half .",pos
1,cv103,11021,32,my formal complaints for the wedding singer aren't very important .,pos
1,cv103,11021,33,"the film is predicable , but who cares ?",pos
1,cv103,11021,34,"the characters are extremely likable , the movie is ridiculously funny , and the experience is simply enjoyable .",pos
1,cv103,11021,35,"in addition to this , i can't imagine anyone seeing the preview and not wanting to see the film .",pos
1,cv103,11021,36,"in that order , i conclude that it is pointless for me to even have written this review .",pos
1,cv103,11021,37,i just want everyone to know that i laughed .,pos
1,cv103,11021,38,a lot .,pos
1,cv104,18134,0,"based on the boris karloff's classic by the same name , the mummy starts off with the high-priest of osiris , imhotep , who murders the pharoah for his mistress and is punished by being mummified in the most horrifying way possible -- bandaged up , having his tongue removed , and being covered in flesh-eating scarab beetles , then entombed . . . all while still alive .",pos
1,cv104,18134,1,"recap a few thousand years later , where a soldier named rick ( played by brandan fraser ) aids a young historian named evelyn ( played by rachel wiesz ) and her brother , jonathan ( played by john hannah ) in finding the book of amon ra , in the process inadvertently freeing the mummy .",pos
1,cv104,18134,2,"problem is that the mummy wants to revive his mistress , using evelyn as a sacrifice . . .",pos
1,cv104,18134,3,"walking in with relatively low expectations , i thought this movie was actually pretty good .",pos
1,cv104,18134,4,"the visuals and cgi are astounding , and obviously not cheaply done at all .",pos
1,cv104,18134,5,"they pack a ton of detail into the images , especially during scenes involving mummies rendered completely by cgi .",pos
1,cv104,18134,6,"the computer special effects makes for some brilliant scenes , such as unnerving moments involving flesh-eating scarab beetles and moments where the mummy goes after the people who freed him ( after all , those who took his artifacts are cursed ) .",pos
1,cv104,18134,7,"unfortunately , the film attempts to be way too much in such a short span of time , becoming a tug of war for control between genres .",pos
1,cv104,18134,8,"on one hand , it is a fast paced action film .",pos
1,cv104,18134,9,"on the other , it's a frightening horror film .",pos
1,cv104,18134,10,"and on the side , it's a hilarious comedy .",pos
1,cv104,18134,11,"ideally , for it to be successful , the film would have to focus on one the more action oriented aspect , with one character serving as the comic relief ( that would be johnson ) .",pos
1,cv104,18134,12,"the problem with this film is that it has at least three characters serving as comic relief , with rick occasionally delivering his witty one-liner .",pos
1,cv104,18134,13,"if they were trying to make a horror-action-comedy , it would have helped if it were established early on in the film , but unfortunately , with the backstory of imhotep's entombment , that would be impossible .",pos
1,cv104,18134,14,and then there's the slapstick fight scene between a sword-wielding rick and an army of mummies .,pos
1,cv104,18134,15,"while really well done , it had the feel of slapstick comedy .",pos
1,cv104,18134,16,replace the sword with a chainsaw and you'd effectively have ash fighting zombies in army of darkness .,pos
1,cv104,18134,17,"while entertaining and funny , it feels really out of place .",pos
1,cv104,18134,18,but at least it's a break from the naive heroes that brendan fraser has been playing a lot of .,pos
1,cv104,18134,19,"on the whole , the movie is pure popcorn fare from beginning to end , entertaining the audience .",pos
1,cv104,18134,20,but i must end my review with a plea to movie theatre owners . . . turn,pos
1,cv104,18134,21,the sound down !,pos
1,cv104,18134,22,"while a lot of theatres have good sound systems , my ears were almost ringing as i walked out of the theatre ( the sound is particularly irritating and will make you crap your pants if you're not careful ) .",pos
1,cv104,18134,23,"when they were showing the trailer for the upcoming schwarzenegger film , "" end of days "" , it was so loud i couldn't make anything out .",pos
1,cv105,17990,0,"on re-watching italian writer/director dario argento's much lauded murder mystery tenebrae , i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with .",pos
1,cv105,17990,1,"in emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles , but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his "" giallo "" murder mysteries .",pos
1,cv105,17990,2,"while it's certainly not perfect , repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller .",pos
1,cv105,17990,3,"the story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal ( anthony franciosa ) where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book "" tenebrae "" .",pos
1,cv105,17990,4,"with the police on his back for leads , he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems .",pos
1,cv105,17990,5,the film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa .,pos
1,cv105,17990,6,"he brings grace , charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding real-life horror around him .",pos
1,cv105,17990,7,the film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension .,pos
1,cv105,17990,8,"argento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral , ambivalent , shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business .",pos
1,cv105,17990,9,tenebrae is perhaps the most multi-layered of argento's scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here .,pos
1,cv105,17990,10,it may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play .,pos
1,cv105,17990,11,in that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red/profondo rosso ( the full-length italian language version ) and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes .,pos
1,cv105,17990,12,"needless to say for argento fans , there is no denying the director's brilliance as a stylist .",pos
1,cv105,17990,13,many of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork .,pos
1,cv105,17990,14,"they are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light , rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria .",pos
1,cv105,17990,15,"instead , tenebrae's set design and lighting paints a sleek , clinical , chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world .",pos
1,cv105,17990,16,and the soundtrack's mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment .,pos
1,cv105,17990,17,"so tenebrae has much to recommend it , no question .",pos
1,cv105,17990,18,"still , constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative .",pos
1,cv105,17990,19,"some critics argue that logic doesn't matter in argento films , but damnit , it matters in all films to the point where viewers don't deserve to feel cheated .",pos
1,cv105,17990,20,"by the way , if you don't want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs .",pos
1,cv105,17990,21,"about an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which , properly handled , could have proved ingenious .",pos
1,cv105,17990,22,"we witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who , we later discover , is none other than the author peter neal .",pos
1,cv105,17990,23,"he is insane , apparently .",pos
1,cv105,17990,24,the murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides it's time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife .,pos
1,cv105,17990,25,"he is finally revealed to us as this "" second killer "" in the film's bloody climax .",pos
1,cv105,17990,26,"but argento muffs the twist , both technically and narratively .",pos
1,cv105,17990,27,"you see , we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killer's house .",pos
1,cv105,17990,28,"but thanks to poor editing , its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway .",pos
1,cv105,17990,29,bad cutting puts the timing way out .,pos
1,cv105,17990,30,"in other words , he's almost in two places at once .",pos
1,cv105,17990,31,during this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring .,pos
1,cv105,17990,32,by the film's end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have self-inflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant .,pos
1,cv105,17990,33,the injury ?,pos
1,cv105,17990,34,he banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock !,pos
1,cv105,17990,35,"thus , the revelation of the "" hero "" as a killer ( and anti-hero ) in the final scenes may still prove shocking , but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled .",pos
1,cv105,17990,36,"helpfully , in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along .",pos
1,cv105,17990,37,"but there too is a problem , as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least .",pos
1,cv105,17990,38,"the story owes us a better understanding of franciosa's mind , his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage .",pos
1,cv105,17990,39,tenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies .,pos
1,cv105,17990,40,"for instance , a teenage boy and girl leave a hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike .",pos
1,cv105,17990,41,"we would assume the rider is the same boy , but it turns out to be some male character we aren't even introduced too !",pos
1,cv105,17990,42,"that's careless filmmaking , pure and simple .",pos
1,cv105,17990,43,"why , you may ask , do i go on about the story's flaws ?",pos
1,cv105,17990,44,"because when it comes to visuals and set pieces , argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world .",pos
1,cv105,17990,45,take one of the extended scenes in tenebrae .,pos
1,cv105,17990,46,an upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts a guard dog to the point where - almost unbelievably - it jumps a high fence and chases her across town .,pos
1,cv105,17990,47,"finally , as she desperately seeks escape from this crazed canine , she accidentally stumbles on the serial killer's lair .",pos
1,cv105,17990,48,"it's an absolutely masterful sequence , tense and exciting , and communicating a wealth of information through visuals alone .",pos
1,cv105,17990,49,and that's exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating .,pos
1,cv105,17990,50,"too often , it seems , argento's films as a whole are less than the sum of their impressive parts .",pos
1,cv105,17990,51,"mind you , if you love murder mysteries then tenebrae is still worth a look .",pos
1,cv105,17990,52,and if you're a fan of argento's unique style of giallo thriller then it's essential .,pos
1,cv105,17990,53,see the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography by luciano tovoli .,pos
1,cv105,17990,54,"it's a stylish , great-looking and quirky film despite the problem narrative .",pos
1,cv105,17990,55,"a shame , because it doesn't have to be that way .",pos
1,cv105,17990,56,"take argento's more recent stendhal syndrome ( 1992 ) , where with the aid of co-writer franco ferrini he fashioned a solid storyline without sacrificing any of his surreal weirdness or visual panache .",pos
1,cv105,17990,57,"proof that he can do it , if he tries . . .",pos
1,cv106,16807,0,"as any sociologist will attest , your childhood and the types of parents that you have will heavily influence your happiness as an adult .",pos
1,cv106,16807,1,parents that are supportive and environments that are nurturing will yield children who will embrace the values and norms that can allow them to live healthy and productive lives .,pos
1,cv106,16807,2,"but if your upbringing is marred with violence , hate and dysfunctionality , then your journey towards a happy adulthood will be saddled with psychological obstacles almost too great to overcome .",pos
1,cv106,16807,3,`affliction' explores how a man never truly escapes the grip of an unforgivingly nightmarish childhood .,pos
1,cv106,16807,4,the man in question is wade whitehouse ( nick nolte ) .,pos
1,cv106,16807,5,here is a man who is like any other citizen on the surface .,pos
1,cv106,16807,6,he is a productive member of the community and goes about his daily routine much like you and me .,pos
1,cv106,16807,7,"but as you scratch beneath the surface , something scary and evil begins to rear its ugly head .",pos
1,cv106,16807,8,we see that he is a mean-tempered person .,pos
1,cv106,16807,9,"he has a hard time taking control of his emotions , which usually gets the better of him .",pos
1,cv106,16807,10,"he is quick to apologize for his actions and wants to be a gentle person , but something is sparking a tendency towards violence .",pos
1,cv106,16807,11,he also has tremendous problems with relationships .,pos
1,cv106,16807,12,he is divorced and his only connection to love is his daughter .,pos
1,cv106,16807,13,but his bearish persona and stature alienates her .,pos
1,cv106,16807,14,he is visibly shaken by her rejection even though she says that she loves him .,pos
1,cv106,16807,15,his demeanor also puts his relationship with a local townsgirl ( sissy spacek ) at risk .,pos
1,cv106,16807,16,"she tries to remain true to him and supportive , but for women unlucky enough to attach themselves to this kind of person , relationships will ultimately end like sentences ending with an exclamation point .",pos
1,cv106,16807,17,"finally , he is spiteful and vindictive .",pos
1,cv106,16807,18,"as a rejected father , he initiates a custody battle that seems hopeless .",pos
1,cv106,16807,19,"as the town's only police officer , he issues a speeding ticket to a man whose father has just died .",pos
1,cv106,16807,20,we can see that this is a man that is both afflicted and living with pain .,pos
1,cv106,16807,21,he is a prisoner and a slave to it .,pos
1,cv106,16807,22,he is moving towards a level of madness and insanity that defies comprehension .,pos
1,cv106,16807,23,what kind of force can move a man to the edge of his emotions and beyond the reach of people who genuinely care for him ?,pos
1,cv106,16807,24,we learn that the answer is his father ( james coburn ) .,pos
1,cv106,16807,25,this is the kind of father that every son would be ashamed to have and that any woman would be afraid to meet .,pos
1,cv106,16807,26,he is an overbearingly misogynistic and frequent drunk who rules with an iron fist .,pos
1,cv106,16807,27,we see his tyrannical behavior through flashbacks .,pos
1,cv106,16807,28,"to heighten the father's churlishness , the flashbacks are shown as home video footage taken by a very frightened person .",pos
1,cv106,16807,29,very effective .,pos

1,cv106,16807,31,"the influence that the father possesses is inescapable , and its unsavory effect clamps down hard on the tortured wade .",pos
1,cv106,16807,32,the result is every son's nightmare ? becoming like the father that one has always dreaded to be .,pos
1,cv106,16807,33,"this is a terrifically presented piece of psychological drama , and nolte turns in a strong performance as a man whose pain seems to become a detriment as well as a necessity .",pos

1,cv106,16807,35,coburn displays heft as the bitter dad .,pos

1,cv106,16807,38,that may turn many moviegoers away .,pos

1,cv107,24319,0,is evil dead ii a bad movie ?,pos
1,cv107,24319,1,"it's full of terrible acting , pointless violence , and plot holes yet it remains a cult classic nearly fifteen years after its release .",pos
1,cv107,24319,2,explaining why this movie stands out from others with similar plots ( including the original evil dead ) is extremely difficult .,pos

1,cv107,24319,13,"sure it's over-the-top , but it is so over-the-top that it is laugh out loud funny ; just try watching ash with a straight face as he unexpectedly is showered with ten gallons of blood , staining his face and knocking him back a few feet .",pos
1,cv107,24319,14,"the whole movie is like this , watch ash get beat up , watch ash defeat the monster , watch ash get beat up again by another even zanier monster .",pos

1,cv107,24319,20,"all of these events , thrown at you from minute one with roller coaster- like camera movements , at first become shocking , then inexplicably funny .",pos
1,cv107,24319,21,"raimi expects the audience to laugh and as the film progresses , he seems to be enjoying himself even more by borrowing the classic mirror scene from the marx brothers' duck soup , then bringing more characters into the picture to comically kill them off .",pos
1,cv107,24319,22,"with a running time of less than an hour and a half , raimi gets away with the impossible , making a horror film with more gore than plot and intentionally more laughs than scares .",pos

1,cv112,11193,0,i'm not quite sure how best to go about writing this review .,pos
1,cv112,11193,1,"i must admit that i was a little disappointed by barry levinson's political satire "" wag the dog , "" but in retrospect , this has less to do with the film itself than with false expectations i had going into it .",pos
1,cv112,11193,2,"quite a few of the reviews i have read led me to believe that this film was absolutely hilarious and would make me laugh out loud the whole way through , and it didn't do that .",pos
1,cv112,11193,3,"they also led me to believe that it would deliver a vicious and all-too-true attack on the way the american political media works , and it didn't quite do that either .",pos

1,cv112,11193,5,"strangelove "" in the tradition of political black comedy , and it most definitely didn't do that .",pos
1,cv112,11193,6,"that said , "" wag the dog "" is actually a very clever satire on the shady manipulations of political figures and those who assist them .",pos
1,cv112,11193,7,"the story revolves around the attempts of political spin doctor conread brean ( robert deniro ) to distract the american public from the accusations that the president , who is up for re-election in two weeks , sexually harassed a young girl in the oval office .",pos
1,cv112,11193,8,"the accusations , the script suggests , are probably untrue , but as brean so pointedly puts it , that isn't particularly relevant : the scandal is likely to derail the president's campaign regardless of its truth or falsehood .",pos
1,cv112,11193,9,"brean , along with his assistant ( anne heche ) , decide to contact hollywood producer stanley motss ( dustin hoffman ) to enlist his help in concocting enough propaganda and special-effects trickery to make it appear that the u . s . is going to war with albanian terrorists and thus propel the president to victory on a wave of patriotic fervor .",pos
1,cv112,11193,10,"as i said , "" wag the dog "" is not quite as laugh-out-loud hilarious as i had expected , but there are some genuinely funny moments to be found here , such as when , in an echo of a familiar movie clich ? , the camera pans out over an urban sunset to the strains of uplifting , inspirational music , then cuts to a studio to reveal that the singing is coming from a group of musicians whom motss has assembled to perform "" we have the right to fight for democracy . """,pos
1,cv112,11193,11,"another scene shows us how , with modern editing equipment , an actress running across a sound stage with a bag of potato chips can be turned into a frightened young girl and her kitten fleeing a terrorist attack on her village .",pos
1,cv112,11193,12,the most consistently effective gag revolves around the propaganda team's attempt to forge a fictional war hero out of sgt .,pos

1,cv112,11193,14,"of course , not everything goes as planned ; the cia , for example , realizes what's going on and strikes a deal with the president's electoral opponent to report to the media that the "" fighting "" has ended , forcing motss and brean to come up with a new angle on the supposed albanian crisis .",pos
1,cv112,11193,15,"still , even with the cia's involvement , the film falls a little short in terms of making this scenario believable .",pos
1,cv112,11193,16,"regardless of the official word from the president or the cia , wouldn't the major media outlets have eastern european correspondents who could verify that there is , in fact , no fighting going on in albania ?",pos
1,cv112,11193,17,"the film never addresses this question , nor does it show the reactions of the american public to the news of the apparent war except for a few scenes which border on the farcical , such as when basketball fans litter the court with shoes in support of the aforementioned sgt .",pos

1,cv112,11193,19,"there was also an instance , towards the end of the film , in which one of motss's forced reinventions of the story seems to contradict what he and brean had been selling to the public thus far and could conceivably have given the game away .",pos
1,cv112,11193,20,"with these plot holes , "" wag the dog "" doesn't quite work as a satire of american politics , but it does send up the mentality that might lead to these kinds of machinations in the first place .",pos
1,cv112,11193,21,"brean and his advisors never seem concerned that what they are doing is unethical ; rather , they worry about how convincing it will be and whether or not they have enough money to pull it off .",pos
1,cv112,11193,22,"the film takes a decidely dark turn towards the end , as we learn how far they are willing to go in order to keep the propaganda campaign a secret .",pos
1,cv112,11193,23,"motss and his hollywood buddies , meanwhile , seem completely out of touch with the rest of the world and just see this undertaking as another creative project .",pos
1,cv112,11193,24,"in fact , one of the sources of conflict in the film is motss's increasing restlessness with the idea of not being able to take credit for producing the fake war ; in his mind , it is the greatest work of art he has ever created .",pos
1,cv112,11193,25,"i think it's fair to say that "" wag the dog "" underachieves a little bit : more attention to the public reaction and tighter plotting might have made this into a four-star film and a classic satire .",pos
1,cv112,11193,26,"still , the issue of an american president using war and patriotism to distract from scandals or domestic unpopularity is a very real one .",pos
1,cv112,11193,27,"wag the dog takes the issue one step further and asks , what if the war wasn't even real ?",pos

1,cv113,23102,15,"in this kind of movie it's almost impossible to get archival pictures from the same time and place being discussed on-screen , but director james moll made a better effort than most at finding specific , or at least relevant , images to go with his subjects' narration .",pos

1,cv114,18398,0,it is easy to label something sentimental or tear jerking when one has not experienced the heartache of losing a child ? whether that may be in life or in death .,pos
1,cv114,18398,1,"after having said that , i will also say that this movie does all of the above very well .",pos
1,cv114,18398,2,"one gets that choking sensation in the throat ( because of grief ) when one brother forgives another for a costly mistake , or when a husband hugs his wife after a long estrangement .",pos

1,cv114,18398,9,"my comment is that she is exceptionally fine strung in this movie , so much so that when she has a nervous break down , the veins on her temples bulge impressively .",pos

1,cv115,25396,13,"co-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : "" creature comforts , "" "" the wrong trousers , "" and "" a close shave . """,pos
1,cv115,25396,14,"the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures .",pos
1,cv115,25396,15,"part of what made the "" wallace "" films brilliantly entertaining was park's uncanny ability to make an old story seem new .",pos

1,cv115,25396,18,"now teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in "" chicken run . """,pos
1,cv115,25396,19,"the plot is largely lifted from "" the great escape "" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement .",pos
1,cv115,25396,20,"thing is , the film doesn't feel like it's been lifted from somewhere else ; "" chicken run "" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done .",pos
1,cv115,25396,21,part of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ?,pos
1,cv115,25396,22,"park and lord milk the incongruity for all it's worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is .",pos
1,cv115,25396,23,"but they're * chickens * , so it's funny to us .",pos
1,cv115,25396,24,"another thing that helps "" chicken run "" ( and most of park's films ) succeed is the animators' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they're cribbing .",pos
1,cv115,25396,25,"there are references to "" the great escape , "" obviously , and "" stalag 17 . """,pos
1,cv115,25396,26,"the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both "" raiders of the lost ark "" and "" indiana jones and the temple of doom . """,pos
1,cv115,25396,27,"there's even a nod to "" the blues brothers , "" if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson's nationality and film history .",pos
1,cv115,25396,28,"the "" braveheart "" reference is a hoot if you catch it .",pos
1,cv115,25396,29,"when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , "" chicken run "" is downright brilliant in its execution .",pos
1,cv115,25396,30,"consider this : since july of last year , i've seen dozens upon dozens of "" blair witch project "" parodies , on television , on the radio , and online .",pos
1,cv115,25396,31,"out of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome .",pos
1,cv115,25396,32,why ?,pos
1,cv115,25396,33,"because once you got past the thought that "" they're parodying that&#8216 ; blair witch' movie , "" most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose .",pos
1,cv115,25396,34,"they were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing .",pos
1,cv115,25396,35,"conversely , "" chicken run "" doesn't lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene .",pos
1,cv115,25396,36,"if you've never seen "" indiana jones , "" the chase sequence is still fun .",pos
1,cv115,25396,37,"even if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character .",pos
1,cv115,25396,38,"park , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it's understood , and as a result , "" chicken run "" is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either .",pos
1,cv115,25396,39,"enjoyment of this movie doesn't require knowledge of film history , but if you've got it , "" chicken run "" is that much richer .",pos
1,cv115,25396,40,"the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it's hard not to fall in love with every one of them .",pos
1,cv115,25396,41,"ginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on "" absolutely fabulous "" ) nails it .",pos
1,cv115,25396,42,"she has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer .",pos
1,cv115,25396,43,"the characters' inevitable romance doesn't feel contrived , but sweet .",pos
1,cv115,25396,44,"poor mr . tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn't any help .",pos
1,cv115,25396,45,"jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence .",pos
1,cv115,25396,46,they even come up with an inspired riff on something that's baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma .,pos
1,cv115,25396,47,"one might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of "" chicken run , "" it comes as a delightful surprise .",pos
1,cv115,25396,48,"the film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens .",pos
1,cv115,25396,49,the animation is first-rate .,pos
1,cv115,25396,50,"remember that this was all done the old-fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how truly remarkable "" chicken run "" really is .",pos
1,cv115,25396,51,this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail .,pos
1,cv115,25396,52,"as in such top-notch family fare as "" a bug's life "" or "" toy story 2 , "" "" chicken run "" has something to offer in nearly every frame .",pos
1,cv115,25396,53,"certainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes , but a active , attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they'll catch all the details .",pos
1,cv115,25396,54,"anyway , the movie's just a boatload of fun .",pos

1,cv116,28942,1,joe johnston directs a straightforward story of an excursion back to the island of the dinosaurs .,pos
1,cv116,28942,2,it lets us see some new dinosaurs ( is that an oxymoron ? ) and gives us a nice and generally reasonably written adventure .,pos
1,cv116,28942,3,the film is neither ambitious nor pretentious .,pos

1,cv116,28942,6,here goes my credibility .,pos
1,cv116,28942,7,this is a film on which i expect to be in a minority .,pos
1,cv116,28942,8,i liked the third jurassic park film .,pos
1,cv116,28942,9,i even liked the second jurassic park film .,pos
1,cv116,28942,10,"in a lot of ways jurassic park : the lost world was a creative three-way braiding together of michael crichton's novel the lost world , arthur conan doyle's novel the lost world , and the classic silent film version of the doyle .",pos
1,cv116,28942,11,"jp2 was an adventure , as doyle said , "" for the boy who's half man or the man who's half boy . """,pos
1,cv116,28942,12,that is what all the jurassic park films are .,pos
1,cv116,28942,13,expecting them to give the viewer insights into the human condition is like expecting your car to vacuum your house .,pos
1,cv116,28942,14,the classic adventure films like gunga din or king solomon's mines had under-written characters also .,pos
1,cv116,28942,15,jurassic park iii is an all out adventure on an island inhabited by dinosaurs .,pos
1,cv116,28942,16,"the characters are a little more complex than they at first appear to be , and even that is a little more complex than i was expecting .",pos
1,cv116,28942,17,some of the characters who start out looking stupid and useless prove to be neither as the film proceeds .,pos
1,cv116,28942,18,that degree of complexity combined with those very realistic looking dinosaur effects is just about as much as i require .,pos
1,cv116,28942,19,i feel i got my money's worth .,pos
1,cv116,28942,20,the story opens with eric ( played by trevor morgan ) and friend parasailing near the forbidden island of isla sorna off costa rica .,pos
1,cv116,28942,21,this was the research island where the dinosaurs were created for the now defunct jurassic park .,pos
1,cv116,28942,22,"they hope , no doubt , to get a look at the island's dinosaurs from a safe height .",pos
1,cv116,28942,23,"the height is safe , but driving the boat in the water is not .",pos
1,cv116,28942,24,the two soon find themselves in trouble and have to ditch their parasail onto the island where they do indeed get a better look at the dinosaurs than they had intended .,pos
1,cv116,28942,25,flash to the united states and someone is offering to fund paleontologist alan grant ( sam neill ) in his research if he will go and fly over isla sorna and act as a guide .,pos
1,cv116,28942,26,he has said that no force on earth or heaven could get him back near real dinosaurs .,pos
1,cv116,28942,27,but again money convinces him to drop what he is doing and go .,pos
1,cv116,28942,28,doing the convincing is a wealthy and eccentric couple ( william h . macy and tea leoni ) who has been just about everywhere else in the world and wants the adventure of seeing real dinosaurs .,pos
1,cv116,28942,29,they too plan to see the island from a safe height grant is relieved to learn .,pos
1,cv116,28942,30,he will fly over this island at a safe altitude just this once .,pos
1,cv116,28942,31,right .,pos
1,cv116,28942,32,guess what happens next ?,pos
1,cv116,28942,33,jp3 probably functions better as a sequel than jp2 .,pos
1,cv116,28942,34,first it has alan grant and ellie sattler ( laura dern ) back rather than the much less appealing ian malcolm .,pos
1,cv116,28942,35,"sattler has a much smaller part in jp3 , but is still present to tie this story to the first .",pos
1,cv116,28942,36,curiously each film seems to arrange to have a signature scene with characters holding on to some large metal object that is about to fall some great distance .,pos
1,cv116,28942,37,"one thing that does not quite fit with the earlier films is just as grant discovers that raptors may be able to talk to each other , suddenly they seem to be doing it all the time .",pos
1,cv116,28942,38,they did not appear to be conversing in the previous films .,pos
1,cv116,28942,39,"of course , these raptors look a little different also , so perhaps they are a different related species .",pos
1,cv116,28942,40,"not only are they more intelligent than in the past films , they are also more sympathetic .",pos
1,cv116,28942,41,"in this story they are not just killing machines , they have reasonable motives for what they do beyond nutrition .",pos
1,cv116,28942,42,this time around they may be a little too anthropomorphized .,pos
1,cv116,28942,43,"each new film in the series introduces us to some new dinosaurs , of course .",pos
1,cv116,28942,44,"in this film a major threat is from a spinosaurus , not as common or as popularly known as a tyrannosaurus , but larger and presumably more nasty .",pos
1,cv116,28942,45,it has a crocodile's head and the body that looks like a dimetrodon walking upright .,pos
1,cv116,28942,46,perhaps as an economy measure or just to create a mood the visual effects team frequently obscures our view of the dinosaurs .,pos
1,cv116,28942,47,sometimes they just move too fast to see .,pos
1,cv116,28942,48,occasionally darkness or fog obscures our vision .,pos
1,cv116,28942,49,"a few times we get unconvincing matte shot , particularly of the laboratory .",pos
1,cv116,28942,50,but there is less money on the screen in terms of dinosaur effects than in the two previous films .,pos
1,cv116,28942,51,the musical score by don davis borrows heavily from john williams's score for the first film .,pos
1,cv116,28942,52,"joe johnston , who directs , already has to his credit two very good films i recommend the rocketeer and october sky .",pos
1,cv116,28942,53,a team including alexander payne and jim taylor known for election writes the screenplay .,pos
1,cv116,28942,54,"the film they have made is a long way from great cinema , but it still is fun .",pos
1,cv116,28942,55,"if you get a thrill from seeing what look very much like live dinosaurs alive today , the film is for you .",pos
1,cv116,28942,56,i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale .,pos
1,cv117,24295,0,"just look back two years ago at the coen brothers' comedic gem the big lebowski , change the actors , take away the bowling alley , add a record store , and you've got high fidelity ( or maybe the other way around since nick hornby's novel high fidelity came first ) .",pos
1,cv117,24295,1,"either way , it's been done before , a trio of losers cracking jokes and complaining about their failed romances , yet it remains consistently funny .",pos
1,cv117,24295,2,why is this ?,pos
1,cv117,24295,3,"maybe because you know your life is much better than this , you know these guys are more pathetic than you are , and you know its ok to laugh at them because they're fictional .",pos
1,cv117,24295,4,"director stephen frears , possibly not intentionally , has created a movie that makes you feel good about yourself and even that ostensibly no good uncle who watches television twenty four hours a day .",pos
1,cv117,24295,5,"when watching high fidelity , expect to laugh at someone else's pain , realize what you are laughing at , and then laugh again .",pos
1,cv117,24295,6,"i laughed at dick ( todd louiso ) , the shy , timorous , steve buscemi character of lebowski , who seems to know what he is talking about but either can't put it into words or is harshly rejected by his friends .",pos
1,cv117,24295,7,"i laughed at the john goodman character barry ( jack black ) , an exact replica of the comic bookstore owner on the simpsons , pudgy , egotistic , and obnoxious at the same time .",pos
1,cv117,24295,8,"and i laughed at rob ( john cusack ) , the jeff bridges type , whom the story revolves around .",pos
1,cv117,24295,9,"rob is the character easiest to relate to , but he is nothing like you at all .",pos
1,cv117,24295,10,"he uncontrollably cheats and lies , then is unable to realize why he can not hold onto a woman .",pos
1,cv117,24295,11,"and like his other miserable friends , pop music is where he inevitably goes for comfort .",pos
1,cv117,24295,12,he spends the afternoons at his job quizzing his coworkers with obscure trivia or listening to new music and either deriding it or praising it .,pos
1,cv117,24295,13,"whatever human emotions the clash , aretha franklin , and bruce springsteen records hold , rob and co .",pos
1,cv117,24295,14,grasp them and help fill voids in their social lives .,pos
1,cv117,24295,15,rob has built an extensive collection in his record store as well as his home and he organizes them depending on what mood he is in .,pos
1,cv117,24295,16,"during this confused stage of his life in which the movie focuses on , rob is trying to cope with numerous rejections over the years by visiting past girlfriends and eventually asking why they dumped him .",pos
1,cv117,24295,17,but these aren't any girlfriends ? these girls made the all time top five break ups in the history of rob ( rob's incessant use of lists show how pop music has played a major role in his life ) .,pos
1,cv117,24295,18,the plot in three words is : women and music .,pos
1,cv117,24295,19,the approach director stephen frears takes by having the charismatic rob speak directly to the camera is very effective .,pos
1,cv117,24295,20,"it gives high fidelity a quickly paced , informal structure , adjectives which perfectly parallel rob's own lifestyle .",pos
1,cv117,24295,21,it also helps open the viewer's eyes as to how annoying barry is .,pos
1,cv117,24295,22,jack black steals the show with a hilariously realistic performance as a total sleaze ball .,pos
1,cv117,24295,23,"just listening to him speak for five minutes makes the audience immediately sympathetic for rob , who must work with him every day of the week .",pos
1,cv117,24295,24,what frears does so well is that he makes us feel sorry for rob while laughing at his misfortunes .,pos
1,cv117,24295,25,"john cusack plays his character convincingly but it is the strong supporting cast , consisting of big stars and character actors , that really defines rob .",pos
1,cv117,24295,26,"now instead of rob just talking to the camera , after he explains something , the remaining cast members physically and humorously create what he is trying to say .",pos
1,cv117,24295,27,the only problem with high fidelity is that it doesn't end when it should have ended .,pos
1,cv117,24295,28,instead the movie goes on for a torturous twenty minutes that seem a lot longer than that .,pos
1,cv117,24295,29,also bruce springsteen is completely wasted in a brief cameo halfway through the movie .,pos
1,cv117,24295,30,"high fidelity is a cheerful , old fashioned comedy with a voluminous soundtrack and as many laughs .",pos
1,cv117,24295,31,"i just hope hollywood keeps creating losers on the big screen , they make everyone look and feel great .",pos
1,cv118,28980,0,plot : a human space astronaut accidentally falls upon a planet ruled by apes .,pos

1,cv118,28980,2,"oh yeah , and did i mention that the apes can talk ?",pos
1,cv118,28980,3,kewl !,pos
1,cv118,28980,4,"critique : despite this film not looking like a "" tim burton movie "" or its lead human character showing any signs of being a human being himself , i did find myself generally entertained throughout most of this film and do recommend it as fun , summer fare .",pos
1,cv118,28980,5,although the thing that sets this movie apart from all others is definitely its incredible ape make-up jobs and characterizations .,pos
1,cv118,28980,6,"i mean , i was completely convinced that every single one of these apes was for real !",pos
1,cv118,28980,7,"i also have to "" give it up "" to all of the actors inside the costumes , not only for waking up at three in the morning every day to get make-up slobbered all over them for 2-4 hours , but for coming through their costumed exteriors and selling us their characters on the screen as well .",pos
1,cv118,28980,8,"i especially enjoyed bonham carter's performance , who i believed to be the most developed character in the entire film ( human or ape ) and tim roth's bad guy , who chewed up scenery and oozed evil in every scene in which he took part .",pos
1,cv118,28980,9,"plot-wise , i liked the beginning of the film , the whole build-up once wahlberg got into the village , the escape and most of the fight scenes , but once things got out into the deserted area ( and the final battle sequence ) , i kinda lost a bit of my interest .",pos
1,cv118,28980,10,"i was much more intrigued by the interactions between the characters and the whole idea of "" human beings as animals "" then i was about the end battle sequence , which just seemed a bit too typical for this kind of film .",pos
1,cv118,28980,11,"i also hated the "" kid "" character who just got on my nerves and didn't really care for the way that the battle sequence was resolved ( i won't ruin it here but c'mon guys . . . you",pos
1,cv118,28980,12,"coulda thought of something a little more plausible than that , no ? ) .",pos
1,cv118,28980,13,"but the thing that held this movie back more than anything else was its lead character , his cold demeanor and the zero chemistry that he shared with either one of his inter-species love interests .",pos
1,cv118,28980,14,this dude didn't seem to give a rat's ass about anyone but himself and i ultimately didn't really care about what happened to him either .,pos
1,cv118,28980,15,"now i'm not sure if this was the fault of the actor or the script , but the film suffered because of it .",pos

1,cv122,7392,10,"this is the theme of sidney lumet's "" fail-safe , "" a fictional drama based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler .",pos
1,cv122,7392,11,""" fail-safe "" takes place during the heart of the cold war ( the actual film was released two years after the cuban missile crisis ) , when the united states and the soviet union were in static discord over an issue that can be summarized in a single word : communism .",pos
1,cv122,7392,12,the premise centers around a combination of accidents and operation flaws .,pos
1,cv122,7392,13,five u . s . bombers carrying nuclear warheads are ordered to set a routine course for moscow after an unidentified aircraft is spotted heading toward america .,pos
1,cv122,7392,14,"the unidentified aircraft turns out to be a commercial airliner , but a mechanical failure strikes the military base that commands the bombers .",pos
1,cv122,7392,15,"suddenly out of contact , and with standing orders to remain on course until receiving new directives , the bomber pilots cannot be recalled , and they proceed to moscow with the intention of destroying it with a nuclear strike .",pos
1,cv122,7392,16,"a great deal of "" fail-safe "" 's plot follows various characters as they attempt to devise ways of stopping the u . s . bombers from reaching russia's borders--at any cost .",pos
1,cv122,7392,17,"the plot is compelling , and the story creates urgency and dread by painting the grimmest of worst case scenarios .",pos
1,cv122,7392,18,the reality sets in quickly as one attempt to turn the bombers after another fails .,pos
1,cv122,7392,19,"general bogan ( frank overton ) , taking orders directly from the president of the united states himself ( henry fonda ) , is powerless--the fate of the world lies in the hands of an automated , pre-programmed system that may not be stoppable , simply because the creators of the war machines were too efficient in their task to make a no-win situation winnable .",pos
1,cv122,7392,20,"the events in "" fail-safe "" are fascinating because they're anything but predictable , but the real reason "" fail-safe "" works is because it understands more about nuclear war than what exists within the confines of its plot .",pos
1,cv122,7392,21,"a key ingredient to the film is its ability to create an ongoing polemic about nuclear war , communism , the cold war , and the united states' role in all of it .",pos
1,cv122,7392,22,"most of this is through the film's use of the character groeteschele ( walter matthau ) , an arrogant civilian theorist of nuclear weapons use who , incidentally , is on the president's advising staff for analyzing the statistical plausibility of waging a nuclear war .",pos
1,cv122,7392,23,many of the film's most pointed messages arise from discussions where groeteschele is one of the key voices .,pos
1,cv122,7392,24,"early in the film , he hosts a dinner party where he explains the importance of "" strategy "" in a nuclear assault to "" minimize "" casualties .",pos

1,cv122,7392,29,the only difference to him between nuclear armageddon and conventional warfare is the raw data and the casualty totals .,pos
1,cv122,7392,30,groeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world several times over .,pos

1,cv122,7392,39,"although "" fail-safe "" is more about the issue of nuclear weapons than it is about the political ramifications of communism , there is a scene in the film that deals with communism in an intentionally superficial , one-sided sort of way .",pos
1,cv122,7392,40,"again , this is achieved through groeteschele , who is easily the film's most important character in terms of the larger-theme significance .",pos
1,cv122,7392,41,"in addition to providing the central "" pro-nuclear war "" voice that the film warns against , he also makes key remarks about communists that show just how much fear and resentment people of the period were prone to when it came to communism .",pos

1,cv122,7392,43,"one of groeteschele's "" logical "" trains of thought ventures so far into fantasy theoretical prediction that it's merely absurd .",pos

1,cv122,7392,45,"groeteschele takes it so far as to say that if the u . s . drops the warhead on moscow , the soviets will * instantly * surrender , for to retaliate would invite counter-measures that would further destroy russia's home soil--which must be preserved at all costs .",pos
1,cv122,7392,46,groeteschele seems to forget these people are human beings with emotions ; general black quickly reminds him that the soviets would attack out of revenge--as any normal person would .,pos
1,cv122,7392,47,the irony here is groeteschele's own mechanical theorizing .,pos
1,cv122,7392,48,he is so quick to judge the enemy that he doesn't even realize his own seemingly programmed thought patterns .,pos
1,cv122,7392,49,"once the film makes it evident that turning the u . s . bombers will be impossible , the question becomes what the * consequences * of destroying moscow will be .",pos

1,cv122,7392,59,the film often warns that the automation of war is something that may make nuclear holocaust an unintentional consequence of such mass arming .,pos
1,cv122,7392,60,"but it was the conscious , human choice to * initialize * this automatic arming that "" fail-safe "" also finds dangerous .",pos

1,cv123,11182,8,"the film plays like a rock opera , much like their "" jesus christ superstar , "" with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals , even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics , which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience , but also a very entertaining one .",pos

1,cv124,4122,10,"how to make an american quilt is basically an unremarkable , if affecting , tale of love across the generations--a sort of truncated american version of the joy luck club , with a dash of fried green tomatoes added .",pos
1,cv124,4122,11,there are probably too many characters .,pos
1,cv124,4122,12,"so , instead of really getting to know a few of them , we are presented with quick glimpses into a single defining event in each of their lives .",pos

1,cv124,4122,21,"on the whole , how to make an american quilt is a nicely-understated drama that has a lot to say about love , passion , and monogamy in relationships .",pos

1,cv125,9391,3,there was more excitement and adrenaline rushed suspense than just about any of hollywood's big blockbuster movies .,pos

1,cv126,28971,1,tim burton's retelling of planet of the apes is more fun than a barrel of monkeys .,pos

1,cv126,28971,3,"no more monkey puns , i promise .",pos

1,cv126,28971,6,"and for those film buffs who are fond of the original , burton's version includes a couple tips of the hat to that movie .",pos

1,cv126,28971,9,"despite being darker than the original , burton's film is not as heavy handed nor as sanctimonious .",pos
1,cv126,28971,10,some of the movie's flashes of humor are surreal as well as typically burton : an organ-grinder ape with a midget or an elderly ape taking off a wig and removing false teeth as he prepares for bed .,pos

1,cv126,28971,15,"lines that hearken back to the original movie are sprinkled throughout : the first words spoken by an ape to davidson as the astronaut is regaining consciousness and grabs the simian's foot to try righting himself are : "" take your stinking hand off of me , you damned , dirty human .

1,cv126,28971,35,"burton's musical collaborator , danny elfman , provides another fine score , though it is not as memorable as his work on batman or sleepy hollow .",pos
1,cv126,28971,36,the movie's only letdown comes at the very end where burton tries to outshock the finale from the 1968 original .,pos
1,cv126,28971,37,"he comes close , but falls short .",pos
1,cv126,28971,38,"otherwise , planet of the apes is what a summer movie should be : an amusement park ride filled with lots of action , stunts and a few laughs .",pos

1,cv127,14711,0,urban legend surprised me .,pos
1,cv127,14711,1,"based on the last few films the genre has produced ( including but not exclusive to the likes of i know what you did last summer , disturbing behavior and the disappointing halloween : h20 ) , i was positive that i was in store for another mildly entertaining but silly and ultimately boring rehash of the scream phenomena .",pos

1,cv127,14711,7,"the thing is , i'm not really sure what made this particular stab ( pardon the pun ) at the genre seem so fresh and alive .",pos
1,cv127,14711,8,"maybe it was the above-par performances by the movie's two leads ( jared leto and "" cybil "" actress alicia witt ) .",pos

1,cv146,18458,43,"the leader of the federation , an alien called viceroy , is following the orders of a strange , mythical character - an older human man whose face and body are covered and shadowed by the black robe and hood he wears .",pos
1,cv146,18458,44,"he is referred to as lord sidious but considering his appearance , and especially that creepy evil voice of his , he is a obviously one of the most significant characters in the series .",pos
1,cv146,18458,45,sidious communicates to viceroy only through digital transmissions and never in person .,pos
1,cv146,18458,46,"clearly his actual whereabouts are something he wants to keep secret because that would also reveal his identity ( which is never openly revealed in the film , but should be clear to most viewers .",pos

1,cv146,18458,48,but it doesn't take the film long to spring into action and within minutes our hero jedi are fighting for their lives and the film's story begins to move along .,pos
1,cv146,18458,49,the film doesn't have one specific plot and works in the same manner as the other films in the series where as what we get is one mini-plot and adventure on top of another .,pos
1,cv146,18458,50,there are so many of these mini-plots-within-plots in this film i would not describe them all because it is what gives the movie its hook .,pos
1,cv146,18458,51,"the other films have relied on this type of storytelling , but because of the limits of the technology at the time , the films' screenplays were also limiting .",pos
1,cv146,18458,52,the sense of limitlessness here is what gives `the phantom menace' its unique traits .,pos
1,cv146,18458,53,"as we already know , the film takes place at least a generation or two before the original `star wars' trilogy which means a lot of the background which was unclear and/or unexplained may be cleared up here as it is the beginning of the vast epic story .",pos
1,cv146,18458,54,"and here the most significant storyline is that involving the discovery of 10-year-old anakin skywalker ( lloyd ) , by qui-gon jinn and his introduction to the jedi council .",pos
1,cv146,18458,55,"to briefly summarize the story , jinn stumbles upon skywalker in an attempt to buy parts for queen amidala's spaceship which was damaged in efforts to free her from the federation .",pos
1,cv146,18458,56,their meeting on tatooine is mostly chance but of course jinn chalks it up to the will of the force .,pos
1,cv146,18458,57,"jinn can feel that skywalker has a great natural power in the force , and through another sub-plot involving a bet on skywalker in a fantastic race he will enter , more and more details of his significance begin to reveal themselves .",pos
1,cv146,18458,58,this also provides for a new elaboration and explanation of the force which has never been mentioned before .,pos
1,cv146,18458,59,"in fact , it seems to be something so important it is upsetting it has never been mentioned before .",pos
1,cv146,18458,60,the element seriously undermines the mystical aspect of the force and transforms it into something more physical and scientific which is completely unnecessary .,pos
1,cv146,18458,61,by the film's third act all the major significant elements become tied together in a rather familiar execution of the plot .,pos
1,cv146,18458,62,"it's funny how the reality of the `star wars' world seems so embedded in mythology , new age-like philosophy and religion and yet the solution to all the major conflicts in the series has been violence .",pos
1,cv146,18458,63,not that this technique hasn't been used in movies and in real-life situations countless times throughout history .,pos
1,cv146,18458,64,and at least it's all in the spirit of the ultimate powers of good versus evil in a fun and exciting matter .,pos
1,cv146,18458,65,"it does border of the cartoonish sometimes , but that's just the film appealing to our inner child , which is the basic reason the entire saga exists and has become such a big part of our modern society .",pos
1,cv146,18458,66,`the phantom menace' delivers exactly what you'd expect from a `star wars' film which is why it succeeds as well as it does but is always why it never truly achieves greatness .,pos
1,cv146,18458,67,so many things in the film we've seen before and done with more heart because the filmmakers concentrated just a bit more on story and character because they were limited .,pos
1,cv146,18458,68,but this film is far from bad because it at least embraces the spirit of sheer fun at the movies .,pos
1,cv147,21193,0,"the story of us , a rob reiner film , is the second movie this fall that touches the viewer in a way they are rarely touched by a film , as they can see their everyday lives in the usually once in a year films .",pos

1,cv147,21193,4,"the film is about two individuals who have come together , spent a good chunk of their lives together , and shows when our main characters are "" him "" and "" her "" ( during the bad times ) , and when they are "" us "" ( during the good times ) .",pos
1,cv147,21193,5,the story of us is about their entire 15 years of marriage that is collapsing day by day .,pos
1,cv147,21193,6,"ben and katie now only see and live with each other because they don't want to devastate their children with the fact that their parents no longer , or at least say they don't , love each other anymore .",pos
1,cv147,21193,7,"ben , a cartoonist , and katie , a crossword puzzle writer , have grown apart during their fifteen years of marriage , as they have grown to follow different views on life , family , and marriage .",pos
1,cv147,21193,8,"katie is the more organized , sophisticated type , who wants to plan everything out , while ben is a spontaneous , adventurous individual who doesn't mind doing things differently than they were planned .",pos
1,cv147,21193,9,"the story of us plays out nicely , as the film opens with ben sharing his story with a therapist , told to the viewer through flashbacks .",pos
1,cv147,21193,10,"as the film progresses , it switches between ben and katie talking to their therapist , with their stories being told with flashbacks of their marriage .",pos
1,cv147,21193,11,"this method is highly effective , as we see the characters changing from year to year , slowly growing apart .",pos
1,cv147,21193,12,"through the flashbacks , we get to see the story of them through both of the character's eyes , and this gives us a strong sense of what their characters are really like , as the story of us has three dimensional , believable main characters .",pos
1,cv147,21193,13,"the screenplay , written by jessie nelson ( stepmom ) and alan zweibel ( dragnet ) , is a touching , down to earth work that hits a chord within the viewer , much like another one of nelson's films , stepmom .",pos
1,cv147,21193,14,"the script has an open honesty and outlook on life , one that is so realistic , you feel uncomfortable at many times , because so many situations the characters are in are undeniably familiar , as most families these days most go through the hard times , as ben and katie must .",pos
1,cv147,21193,15,"if it wasn't for the first 15 minutes that the writers wrote , which are rugged and certainly flawed , the story of us would have been this year's best picture .",pos
1,cv147,21193,16,"bruce willis , a usual action/adventure star , has certainly turned himself around in the past year- he went from being a man who was being typecast to the same role in action movies , to a distinguished , sophisticated actor , as in last summer's the sixth sense ; and now in the story of us , willis shows the world what he can really do if he is fed a good script .",pos
1,cv147,21193,17,"although i wouldn't pick willis as the choice actor for ben jordan , willis handles himself nicely , and shines in a few of the film's most powerful scenes , enough that make his performance a definite contender comes awards season .",pos
1,cv147,21193,18,where to start about michelle pfeiffer ?,pos
1,cv147,21193,19,"pfeiffer's performance is spellbinding and ultimately strong , as she brings her character to life with such charisma and emotion , you wonder how , how it is possible for someone to portray a real person with such realism .",pos
1,cv147,21193,20,"pfeiffer's performance is one that if not recognized by the academy next spring , will be in the heart's of any viewer that has watched this moving film .",pos
1,cv147,21193,21,"the story of us is one of 1999's most real , yet funny films , as the razor sharp script evens out the laughs and the tears to keep the viewer hooked .",pos
1,cv147,21193,22,"superb acting , direction , writing , story , and soundtrack that always sets the mood for the film , which is beautifully composed by eric clapton and marc shaiman , make the story of us a touching , unforgettable motion picture that will touch the hearts of viewers across the country- and will certainly become one of the most talked about movies of the fall .",pos
1,cv147,21193,23,"the film's major high points are the fights between ben and katie , as the two constantly accuse of each other of whose fault it is that their marriage has collapsed , and although they also say things like "" it's over , "" or "" i hate you , "" you can tell the two still share a deep connection , and that inside , somewhere , they are still an "" us .

1,cv148,16345,9,"the outrageous remarks bulworth makes to his potential voters are very funny , and also somewhat true .",pos
1,cv148,16345,10,it's great that beatty isn't afraid to let loose on a subject .,pos

1,cv148,16345,27,"best of all , the film is thought provoking , but directed and written in such a way that the film feels as light as a feather , and is very entertaining .",pos

1,cv149,15670,11,although the script does not perform well as a narrative -- there's little story to be told outside of patch's skit-length experiences -- the script does go a long way toward building the relationships of characters .,pos

1,cv162,10424,2,"on december 20 , 1996 , amidst all the year-end oscar bait releases from the major studios , miramax's genre label dimension films quietly released a sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream .",pos
1,cv162,10424,3,"although the teen horror market had been given up for all-but-dead in recent years , the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistently high box office returns , eventually topping $100 million domestic and becoming one of the most successful films of its type in history , while delighting audiences by finally presenting a set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard cliches associated with the genre .",pos
1,cv162,10424,4,"the sleeper success of scream sent shockwaves through the industry -- suddenly , everybody was looking for hip , inexpensive fright films that might be able to reap similar fortunes .",pos
1,cv162,10424,5,the strategy of casting young tv stars to draw the youth demographic was given a boost .,pos
1,cv162,10424,6,"scream director wes craven , previously best known as the creator of new line's a nightmare on elm street film series , was thrust back into the limelight .",pos
1,cv162,10424,7,"and scream's rookie scribe , kevin williamson , burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion .",pos
1,cv162,10424,8,it's hard to understate this last point .,pos
1,cv162,10424,9,"mr . williamson has , based upon his produced screenplays as of this writing ( scream , i know what you did last summer from october 1997 , and now scream 2 ) , enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame , quickly become the most well-known screenwriter amongst the entertainment weekly-reading , box office figure-watching youth culture since -- well , since that quentin tarantino guy ( whom , it is said , has also achieved some renown as a director ) .",pos
1,cv162,10424,10,"indeed , in a singularly freakish oddity , it is the screenwriter , mr . williamson , and not the director that has been receiving the lion's share of acclaim for the success of scream , and the print advertisements for scream 2's theatrical release are similarly indicative of his increasing prominence : while the traditional "" a film by wes craven "" drapes the film's title in the ads , right below it ( in equal sized font , yet ) reads "" written by kevin williamson "" , an affirmation of the screenwriter's contribution to the project which may be unprecedented .",pos
1,cv162,10424,11,"( i can envision the board of wga , licking their chops at this coup and counting the days until their goal of "" a film by "" is attained . )",pos
1,cv162,10424,12,"and , much like mr . tarantino's screenwriting , mr . williamson's work is vaguely unconventional , incorporating both contemporary pop culture references and allusions to other films into the dialogue of his characters .",pos
1,cv162,10424,13,"in scream , they satirically discussed other horror films ; here in the sequel , the characters discuss the relative merits of film sequels .",pos
1,cv162,10424,14,"scream was written in 1995 during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood , and mr . williamson's rejection of this tirade clearly influenced the writing in both that film and this sequel .",pos
1,cv162,10424,15,"while the sequel was planned from the outset -- a treatment of scream 2 was included when mr . williamson sold the screenplay for scream -- the basic premise for the film and the reunion of the surviving characters nevertheless seems extremely artificially contrived , and it's only at about the film's midway point when it becomes engaging .",pos
1,cv162,10424,16,"like its predecessor , scream 2 opens with a splashy , eye-grabbing prologue which only vaguely ties into the film's principal narrative ; this time around , we're following the exploits of a young couple ( jada pinkett and omar epps ) attending a riotously gleeful sneak preview screening of stab ( a running film-within-a-film gag where the "" true life "" events behind the first film has been turned into a movie ) .",pos
1,cv162,10424,17,"however , although it tries hard and has some good ideas -- the nightmarishly enthusiastic audience in the film vaguely reminded me of the one i was sharing the theatre with , and i was certainly thinking about gutting the overly-noisy person a few seats away myself after about fifteen minutes -- the prologue is a pale imitation of the bravura opening sequence in the original with drew barrymore ( where her performance not only convinced me that she * could * act , but was so good that it would rank among the best performances in a horror film that i've ever seen ) .",pos
1,cv162,10424,18,"there are too many knowing , hip pop-culture references crammed into the scream 2 sequence , and the setup isn't nearly as cleverly frightening as scream's ; while the first film's preface dizzyingly built up to a final shot that was exhilaratingly terrifying , the payoff here is almost campily theatrical .",pos
1,cv162,10424,19,"flash to the campus of a smalltown ohio college , where returning characters sidney ( neve campbell ) and randy ( jamie kennedy ) have relocated for their studies and to escape the notoriety from the events in the first film .",pos
1,cv162,10424,20,"the murders which open this film result in reuniting the survivors -- single-minded tabloid tv reporter gale weathers ( courteney cox ) roars into town to cover the breaking story , while ever-awkward former deputy dewey riley ( david arquette ) flies in to protectively guard over sidney .",pos
1,cv162,10424,21,"they're joined by cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , who was falsely accused of homicide in a cameo appearance during the first film ; his role here is significantly expanded .",pos
1,cv162,10424,22,"the film incidentally provides surprisingly little backstory , although i suppose a good case can be made that it really isn't necessary -- not because so many people have seen the first installment , but because this is , after all , a sequel to a slasher film : what do you * think * happened to these characters in the prior movie ?",pos
1,cv162,10424,23,"there's a lot of new faces on the scene too : sidney's new boyfriend , derek ( jerry o'connell ) and her new roommate hallie ( elise neal ) , randy's fellow film student mickey ( timothy olyphant ) , gale's newly-assigned nervous cameraman joel ( duane martin ) , omnipresent local journalist debbie salt ( laurie metcalf ) , co-ed cici cooper ( ms . buffy herself , sarah michelle gellar ) , and a pair of simpering sorority sisters ( rebecca gayheart and sirens' portia di rossi ) .",pos
1,cv162,10424,24,"any of these characters could be the killer -- or for that matter , could be the next victim .",pos
1,cv162,10424,25,"as is seemingly becoming a regular staple of a kevin williamson screenplay , the narrative is once again framed around the increasingly-flimsy premise of a whodunit .",pos
1,cv162,10424,26,one problem that scream didn't have was keeping you interested in the identity of the killer .,pos
1,cv162,10424,27,"here ( and to some extent in i know what you did last summer ) , mr . williamson's screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying to turn the identity of the killer into a mystery .",pos
1,cv162,10424,28,the film occasionally becomes so bogged down with misdirection that you can sense it straining at the seams to try and drop red herrings left and right at the expense of its thriller elements .,pos

1,cv162,10424,30,"indeed , the finale plays as full-out camp when the villain is finally unmasked , frothing at the mouth with glazed eyes .",pos
1,cv162,10424,31,"this is one of those cases where the villain goes on such an endless diatribe about their machinations , scheming , and motivation , that you actually get bored listening and just want them all to get on with it .",pos
1,cv162,10424,32,"while the basic setup and premise for the film is fairly contrived , the aspect where it's head-and-shoulders above its predecessor is in its suspense sequences .",pos
1,cv162,10424,33,"they're staged much more imaginatively here ( save for the first post-prologue murder , which is handled in such a mediocre , conventional fashion that it seems to be culled directly from the predictable 1980s slasher flicks that the first film satirized ) , and are much more fun to watch .",pos
1,cv162,10424,34,"it's hard to hold back a smile during a giddy scene where sidney and her companion have to climb over the incapacitated killer in order to escape from a car wreck , and a cat-and-mouse chase involving gale and dewey in a campus sound lab is very nicely staged , although its ultimate resolution is hilariously overblown .",pos
1,cv162,10424,35,"in terms of its characters , the strong part of the film is the interesting relationship between gale and dewey ( who ambles onto the screen accompanied by his very own theme music ) .",pos
1,cv162,10424,36,their verbal sparring at the outset provides much humour -- an exchange where dewey defensively rebukes charges of a perceived aura of incompetency is well-written -- and there's a curiously endearing aspect about their relationship amidst all the mayhem and bloodshed .,pos
1,cv162,10424,37,"on the other hand , sidney is pretty dull here .",pos
1,cv162,10424,38,"she doesn't have any compelling presence , and there's nothing particularly interesting about her this time around to make us care about her other than that she's the returning heroine .",pos
1,cv162,10424,39,"given this , and the fact that there's no strong second banana character for sidney ( elise neal's role isn't nearly substantive enough to adequately fill rose mcgowan's shoes ) , it's no wonder why the roles for gale and dewey have been significantly augmented for this installment of the film .",pos
1,cv162,10424,40,what surprises me the most about scream 2 is its zealousness in decimating its cast .,pos
1,cv162,10424,41,"the film's mounting body count bears out the fact that * no * character is safe ( well , * almost * ) ; while in principal i applaud this bold policy , at some point you've got to be wondering about just how many characters will make it to the next sequel .",pos
1,cv162,10424,42,"( i was particularly surprised with the untimely demise of one in particular , whose casting for the next installment of the series would've seemed obvious . )",pos

1,cv163,10052,6,"while the animation for the film is , as is typically the case for disney films , unquestionably top-notch , the magic in the little mermaid is not its animation , but the wonderful innocence of its story and its rousingly superb music .",pos

1,cv163,10052,10,"this simple but touching love story , coupled with a healthy dose of smart humour , makes the little mermaid a remarkably captivating picture .",pos
1,cv163,10052,11,one of the interesting things about the little mermaid is something which now curiously dates it : the voices cast for its motley crew of characters .,pos
1,cv163,10052,12,"this film was produced just before the distracting concept of using celebrity voices became in vogue , which started to a certain degree with beauty and the beast and was irrevocably exacerbated by robin williams' much-heralded turn in aladdin ; by the release of the lion king and henceforth , the majority of characters in the animated films were voiced by celebrities .",pos
1,cv163,10052,13,"while it's understandable that animated features lacking the name-recognition or drawing power of disney ( say , balto's use of kevin bacon and bridget fonda , or even anastasia's showcasing of meg ryan and john cusack ) would be forced to turn to this strategy in order to hype their products , it's unfortunate that even disney has embraced this policy .",pos
1,cv163,10052,14,"do we really need to hear , say , demi moore as esmerelda in the hunchback of notre dame ?",pos
1,cv163,10052,15,"is the film's entertainment value really augmented by hearing a recognizable voice , rather than a voice which best suits the role ?",pos
1,cv163,10052,16,( i'm not exactly on the edge of my seat for eddie murphy in the upcoming mulan . ),pos
1,cv163,10052,17,"fortunately , the performers who voice the characters in the little mermaid , although perhaps more obscure , are impeccably cast .",pos
1,cv163,10052,18,"chief among them is jodi benson , a 1992 tony nominee for her stage work in crazy for you , who voices the film's heroine ariel to perfection ; with a wonderfully expressive speaking voice full of youthful vigor , and gorgeous singing voice , ms . benson provides a most engaging anchor for the film .",pos
1,cv163,10052,19,( she's the only reason i'd even consider catching flubber . ),pos
1,cv163,10052,20,"similarly , samuel e . wright is terrific in the showy role of sebastian , the weary guardian crab .",pos
1,cv163,10052,21,"he easily milks his lovable character's comic moments for all they're worth , and his rendering of two of the little mermaid's big tunes -- "" under the sea "" and "" kiss the girl "" -- have become the stuff of legend .",pos
1,cv163,10052,22,"pat carrol is deliciously villainous and vampy as the evil sea-witch ursula , while kenneth mars' booming voice conveys the stern yet affectionate authority of ariel's father , king triton .",pos
1,cv163,10052,23,"in large roles and small ( edie mcclurg as dotting busybody carlotta is ideal , and rene auberjonois has great fun with his exuberant french chef ) , the little mermaid is impeccably cast .",pos
1,cv163,10052,24,"of course , the little mermaid will probably be best remembered for its remarkable collection of songs composed by the songwriting team of alan menken ( music ) and howard ashman ( lyrics ) , who had created little shop of horrors and would go on to compose beauty and the beast and aladdin for disney before mr . ashman's untimely death .",pos
1,cv163,10052,25,"not only are mr . menken's tunes unbearably catchy , but mr . ashman's charming lyrics are fully integrated into the film's storyline so that the songs are a virtual extension of the character's dialogue , and consequently work wonderfully within the context of the film .",pos
1,cv163,10052,26,mr . menken's score for the film is equally top-notch ; the sequence where eric ( voiced by christopher daniel barnes ) and ariel tour his kingdom in a horse-drawn carriage becomes magical and wondrous with mr . menken's fine score .,pos
1,cv163,10052,27,"it appears that most people prefer the delightfully colourful production number for the calypso-styled "" under the sea "" as joyfully crooned by mr . wright , which won the academy award and golden globe awards for best song -- indeed , one of the many little joys in screening the film during its re-release was listening to children scattered throughout the audience singing along with the tune -- but my favourite is ms . benson's heartfelt rendition of the ballad "" part of your world "" , an achingly beautiful tune of yearning and hope ( wonderfully lyricized by mr . ashman ) which , accompanied by the film's most dazzlingly polished animation sequence , packs an emotional wallop which literally brought tears to my eyes .",pos
1,cv163,10052,28,"during the song's reprise , which builds to a crescendo with ariel arching on a rock as a wave crashes in , the cumulative effect is nothing short of breathtaking , and one becomes acutely aware that this single instance is one of the finest in animation history .",pos
1,cv163,10052,29,"as of this writing , november 1997 has come to an end , as has disney's limited 17-day re-release of the little mermaid .",pos
1,cv163,10052,30,"there's no question that the primary motivation for , if not the film's reissue itself , at least its timing , was to reinforce disney's dominance in the animation market and provide direct competition to fox's costly new upstart animation division and their first major venture , anastasia .",pos
1,cv163,10052,31,"in every respect , the re-release of the little mermaid appears to be a success -- the film's 1997 grosses have pushed its cumulative domestic gross over the magic $100 million mark ; the little mermaid proved to have remarkably strong drawing power for a film initially released only eight years ago and in many homes on video , pulling in close to $10 million in its opening weekend ; and although nobody could possibly expect the little mermaid to possibly defeat the aggressively-marketed anastasia in head-to-head competition , it siphoned enough from the fox film's opening weekend totals to keep anastasia from the coveted weekend leader spot , allowing for disney's odious flubber to sweep in on the subsequent week and wrestle the family demographic market share away .",pos
1,cv163,10052,32,"but although disney's motives in the reissue of the little mermaid were self-serving and protectionist , the real winner is the public .",pos

1,cv164,22447,9,"shepard narrates from a first person point-of-view , divulging his various adventures one snowy december , in which visions of taking aim with his new bb gun replaced that of sugarplums dancing in his head .",pos
1,cv164,22447,10,"shepard's first-hand commentary of several situations is not only downright hilarious , but also witty and warm , with various metaphorical meanings that ring perfectly with the essence of comic timing .",pos
1,cv164,22447,11,"on top of that , young billingsley's stupefied reactions to each predicament is absolutely perfect in contrast with the narration .",pos

1,cv164,22447,17,"for instance , he is a bloodthirsty turkey hound , and she is forgiving and understanding when it comes to some serious issues .",pos
1,cv164,22447,18,"in portraying the writer as a persistent but mild-mannered young lad , peter billingsley has struck quite the chord .",pos

1,cv164,22447,25,"again , shepard's method of handling this amusing scenario is nothing short of comic wizardry .",pos
1,cv164,22447,26,"the numerous sequences that stick in one's mind include , of course , the famous department store santa scene - in which billingsley has some problems in telling old saint nick what he wants under the tree .",pos
1,cv164,22447,27,"i could go on , but i'll finish on this note : `a christmas story' is a standout among holiday movies , because it captures so much in a meager 90 minutes .",pos

1,cv165,22619,46,the rain of frogs depicted in this film may be of greater scale than i had pictured for a rain of frogs .,pos
1,cv165,22619,47,it seems unlikely the frogs would still be alive when dropped .,pos

1,cv165,22619,52,in the film it is left ambiguous if the rain is a sign from god since there are many references to exodus 8 : 2 .,pos
1,cv165,22619,53,""" and the frogs shall come up both on thee and upon thy people , and upon all thy servants . """,pos
1,cv165,22619,54,"however a rain of frogs , though it feels biblical , is most definitely not a biblical portent .",pos
1,cv165,22619,55,"note that the previous verse says "" and the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly which shall go up . . . , """,pos
1,cv165,22619,56,so the bible is referring not to a rain but to an infestation from the river .,pos

1,cv166,11052,2,"the same can't be said for films like independance day , but that's because contact is a rare example in sci-fi filmmaking where the story is treated more importantly than the special effects , and all of us know looking back that id4 didn't offer much outside of some one-time delightful eye candy .",pos
1,cv166,11052,3,"contact's wonderfully presented story deals with ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) , a radio astronomer whose preference of study involves the outdated technique of "" merely listening "" to sounds out in space .",pos

1,cv179,9228,8,"a horrific long take that shows the bus sliding , then stopping , then collapsing into a frozen lake , is the best digital trickery in any movie this year and , perhaps , ever , in a motion picture .",pos

1,cv179,9228,10,"i have a problem not with the story or story structure , but with egoyan's heavy- handedness behind the camera .",pos
1,cv179,9228,11,"for the first hour or so , i can quite honestly say i was on the verge of tears ; these are miserable , miserable people .",pos
1,cv179,9228,12,"but that's just the problem : so anguished are these folk that sympathy wanes after a while , when a lot of sadness becomes too much .",pos
1,cv179,9228,13,"also , a subplot involving incest rings untrue .",pos
1,cv179,9228,14,perhaps it wouldn't feel so contrived if it weren't shot in such a tasteful manner .,pos
1,cv179,9228,15,there are two characters who are father and daughter ; when they first appeared i thought they were lovers .,pos
1,cv179,9228,16,i was half-right .,pos
1,cv179,9228,17,nevertheless it's worth-seeing .,pos
1,cv179,9228,18,"the delightful critic geoff pevere recently wrote that "" american films are about action , canadian films are about consequences , "" hence a recent wave of films about the effects of shock and death from toronto directors , including crash and kissed .",pos
1,cv179,9228,19,"the sweet hereafter is much better than either of these two films , simply because it's not boring or , in the case of kissed , afraid of its own material ( necrophilia ) .",pos
1,cv179,9228,20,"egoyan is a fine , fine , postmodern storyteller , whose work is entertaining , edgy and smart , if a bit too intellectual at times .",pos
1,cv179,9228,21,"though i harped on the weightiness of the material , i was always absorbed , engrossed , and surprised by the sweet hereafter .",pos
1,cv180,16113,0,"i know what i would do with $4 . 4 million if i found it in a previously undiscovered airplane crash site , especially if i were with jacob and lou .",pos

1,cv180,16113,4,"against his better judgement , hank decides to go along with the idea of keeping it rather than going to the authorities .",pos
1,cv180,16113,5,"the rest of the film is a question of who is going to die to keep this a secret , and is it worth it ?",pos
1,cv180,16113,6,"a simple wish lies along the lines of very bad things , clay pigeons and even fargo , and is kind of wrapped all into one little dark bundle .",pos
1,cv180,16113,7,"oh , and its much better than any of those .",pos
1,cv180,16113,8,sam raimi took a departure from his normal freak-show horror-monkey films and made this stylish and intriguing picture .,pos
1,cv180,16113,9,he really lets the audience sit back and watch the events unfold rather than force them down our throats as many directors prefer to do .,pos
1,cv180,16113,10,i think raimi knew he had a winner on his hands and decided to direct the picture on a natural flowing course .,pos
1,cv180,16113,11,one of the film's components can be linked to a recurring theme in terrence malick's the thin red line .,pos
1,cv180,16113,12,"in malick's three hour bore-a-thon , he makes an interesting attempt to link mother earth to his war story .",pos
1,cv180,16113,13,"it seemed nothing more than an occasional pretty cut to a field of flowing grass , a small bird , or a flowing body of water .",pos
1,cv180,16113,14,"sure , there were obvious metaphorical connections , but there was no subtlty to his efforts .",pos
1,cv180,16113,15,raimi does a fine job of tying in a fox in a chicken coop and birds of prey to signify the future of the characters .,pos
1,cv180,16113,16,"i think most viewers may miss the comparison , but it is a very intriguing ingredient in the film .",pos
1,cv180,16113,17,"and then there's billy bob thorton , who is proof that the independent film industry is vital to the life blood of hollywood .",pos
1,cv180,16113,18,"if it can continute to produce people like thorton , hollywood will be ok .",pos
1,cv180,16113,19,he gives a fantastic and devastatingly deep performance here .,pos
1,cv180,16113,20,"it is not as engrossing as his carl childers character in slingblade , but is is just as complex , if not more so .",pos
1,cv180,16113,21,"jacob is slow and simple , and yet we so often see him deep in thought .",pos
1,cv180,16113,22,i wondered if he was thinking about things that he would never say ( or didn't know how to say ) or if he was just taking a long time to think about the thing he just said .,pos
1,cv180,16113,23,here he really proves his worth as one of the best character actors in the industry .,pos
1,cv180,16113,24,"though the plot is somewhat unoriginal , it has a very appealing new twist in its characters .",pos
1,cv180,16113,25,paxton gives one of the better performances of his career as the straight and serious leader of the group ( a far cry from chet in wierd science ) .,pos
1,cv180,16113,26,"perhaps bridget fonda is miscast as his advice-giving wife , but she certainly doesn't do anything ruin the picture .",pos
1,cv180,16113,27,a simple plan can be included in the group of recent small hollywood films that is just dark and pretty un-redeeming .,pos
1,cv180,16113,28,"but at least this one has an important message , unlike so many of its counterparts .",pos
1,cv181,14401,0,"i saw simon birch in a basically sold out theater , on a sunday afternoon .",pos
1,cv181,14401,1,"when the movie was over and the audience was exiting , i didn't hear one negative comment , and i didn't have any to offer .",pos
1,cv181,14401,2,"simon birch is primarily about the friendship of two twelve year old boys , simon ( ian michael smith ) and joe ( joseph mazzello ) , and what destiny holds for both of them .",pos
1,cv181,14401,3,"simon is a dwarf , who was not supposed to last through the night after birth due to a weak heart .",pos
1,cv181,14401,4,"surprisingly , he does , and now constantly reminds everyone that he is a living miracle .",pos

1,cv181,14401,6,"joe is an illegitimate child ( referred to both comically and dramatically throughout the film as a bastard ) , who's mom ( ashley judd ) won't tell him who his father is .",pos

1,cv181,14401,8,"even his own parents don't care about him , and are disappointed they didn't have a "" normal "" son .",pos
1,cv181,14401,9,"he is also harassed in church by the local pastor , rev . russell ( david strathairn ) and simon's chain smoking sunday school teacher played by jan hooks .",pos
1,cv181,14401,10,"the only person , other than joe , that really cares for simon is joe's mom , who he also looks up to as a mother .",pos
1,cv181,14401,11,"it would be just simon's luck , that he would accidentally kills joe's mom , something you are told at the beginning of the movie .",pos
1,cv181,14401,12,"joe , now motherless as well as fatherless , feels the need to find out who his real father is .",pos
1,cv181,14401,13,"with the help of ben ( oliver platt ) , the local drama teacher and joe's mom's current boyfriend ( before her death ) , he will attempt to locate his dad and get in a little trouble on the way .",pos
1,cv181,14401,14,"most of this trouble is laugh out loud funny , although not all of it is .",pos
1,cv181,14401,15,"simon will also look for god's plan for him , although he loses a little faith along the way .",pos
1,cv181,14401,16,"starring in the first ( and last ) five minutes of the film is hollywood's newest dramatic actor , jim carrey .",pos
1,cv181,14401,17,"jim plays the adult version of joe and does a impressive job starting the film off , and then tying it up just right .",pos
1,cv181,14401,18,"this is the first character jim has played that is not over the top in anyway , and he does a commendable job .",pos
1,cv181,14401,19,"simon birch is written and directed by mark steven johnson , this is his first film as director , but he has written several films , including the grumpy old men series .",pos
1,cv181,14401,20,"he does an outstanding writing and directing job here , the film's structure is flawless and its flows together perfectly .",pos
1,cv181,14401,21,the dialog goes from extremely funny to morose without missing a beat .,pos
1,cv181,14401,22,the cast is excellent .,pos
1,cv181,14401,23,joseph mazzello gives the stand out performance .,pos
1,cv181,14401,24,"joseph is outstanding for someone of any age , not alone someone who just turned 15 .",pos
1,cv181,14401,25,"ian michael smith , in his film debut , has such a strong physical presence that you believe he is simon without any hesitation .",pos
1,cv181,14401,26,other great performances are turned in by the rest of the supporting cast .,pos

1,cv182,7281,0,"the saint was actually a little better than i expected it to be , in some ways .",pos
1,cv182,7281,1,"in this theatrical remake of the television series the saint , and its series sequel the return of the saint , val kilmer plays simon templar , an elusive thief who makes a living by stealing things from others for others .",pos
1,cv182,7281,2,this movie closely resembles a james bond flick .,pos
1,cv182,7281,3,"it has the classic bond symbols : a man who can do just about anything and get away with it , a woman whom the man persues , a villain out to achieve something for himself who kills anyone to reach this goal .",pos
1,cv182,7281,4,"kilmer actually provides a rather good role in this movie , although at times you are left to ponder how he actually gets out of the many tight situations .",pos
1,cv182,7281,5,the movie begins in his childhood in a strict school run by catholic priests .,pos
1,cv182,7281,6,"as a young boy , kilmer's character enjoyed magic and would often journey away from his schoolwork .",pos

1,cv182,7281,8,he refuses to do so and instead announces who he wishes to be .,pos
1,cv182,7281,9,"this leads to a devestating mistake , which is something that will stay in his mind throughout his life .",pos
1,cv182,7281,10,"kilmer's first mission that we are shown is to steal a microchip from ivan tretiak , played by rade serbedzija .",pos
1,cv182,7281,11,"during a press conference , he must make his way into a heavily guarded vault area , avoiding guards , cameras , and many other potential obstacles .",pos

1,cv182,7281,16,"the only problem is , tretiak would like to have this for himself and use it to gain power amongst the people .",pos

1,cv182,7281,18,"tretiak hires him to steal the equations , small pieces of paper , from shue .",pos
1,cv182,7281,19,one of the enjoyable features in the film is the disguises that kilmer dawns to complete his missions .,pos
1,cv182,7281,20,"they are very convincing , not only to the characters in the movie , but to us .",pos
1,cv182,7281,21,"kilmer utilizes one such disguise to lure shue's character into getting to know him even more , which would provide him a means of stealing the energy formula .",pos
1,cv182,7281,22,"when the two meet , and end up having a sensual experience , kilmer's character is seemingly falling in love with emma russell , as she is falling in love with kilmer's alter-ego , a traveling artist .",pos

1,cv182,7281,25,"when she finds him , they are left to team up and reclaim the energy formulas from tretiak .",pos
1,cv182,7281,26,"the saint is very action-packed , with few slow points .",pos
1,cv182,7281,27,the sound was very well done and added to the many intense moments .,pos
1,cv182,7281,28,"along the course of the movie , there are even a few , although brief moments of comedy .",pos
1,cv182,7281,29,"these moments are almost always thanks to kilmer's extraneous , very convincing disguises and personalities .",pos
1,cv182,7281,30,"all in all , a rather enjoyable movie with nearly non-stop action .",pos
1,cv183,18612,0,"the thirteenth floor , the third in what i would call "" the reality check movie series "" , is very similar to the other reality check movies released this year , the matrix and existenz .",pos
1,cv183,18612,1,"all three made you think , made you wonder what is real , what isn't , and if our world is just a huge game .",pos
1,cv183,18612,2,"the thirteenth floor doesn't reach the level of originality , creativity , and curiosity sparked by the matrix and existenz , but it certainly gives a great shot at it .",pos
1,cv183,18612,3,"in the matrix , we were told that the humans are simply a virus .",pos
1,cv183,18612,4,"in existenz , we learned that our life could be just a game .",pos
1,cv183,18612,5,"in the thirteenth floor , we learn that we are just electronic devices , living under another world of electronic devices .",pos
1,cv183,18612,6,"there is just one world on top of another , and everything in them are fake and electronically generated .",pos
1,cv183,18612,7,"the thirteenth floor took a huge , risky turn that i didn't expect it to take , and i'm not very sure it was such a great turn to make .",pos
1,cv183,18612,8,"rather than focusing just on the reality parts of the film , the thirteenth floor becomes a murder mystery that ends up tying in with the different worlds .",pos
1,cv183,18612,9,"after the mysterious murder of computer program designer hammond fuller , played by armin mueller-stahl , douglas hall , played by craig bierko , a man that worked under fuller for many years , must travel through an electronic computer device that fuller was using , to the year 1937 , which consists of computer generated characters only .",pos
1,cv183,18612,10,the simulation of 1937 is just like it was back in the olden days .,pos
1,cv183,18612,11,"all of the people involved are just characters , or are they ?",pos
1,cv183,18612,12,"douglas strongly believes that a character traveled through the transport from their world to ours , and killed fuller .",pos
1,cv183,18612,13,"along the way , douglas interacts with many different potential suspects , and a woman who claims to be the daughter of fuller , jane fuller , played wonderfully by a talented young actress , gretchen mol .",pos
1,cv183,18612,14,"the thirteenth floor is a plot driven movie from the time the film gets going , and doesn't use spectacular special effects and big sound to keep the viewer's interests .",pos
1,cv183,18612,15,"i was worried that this film would be too much like the matrix and existenz , and i wouldn't enjoy it , but there were enough twists and turns to keep me thinking and attentive to the film .",pos
1,cv183,18612,16,"unfortunately , many potential would have been great scenes were thrown away with predictable content , letting the viewer know the outcome of the scene long before it happened .",pos
1,cv183,18612,17,"the scenes that aren't original or interesting seem to go absolutely nowhere , leaving you wondering , "" what is the point of this ? """,pos
1,cv183,18612,18,"sometimes it was hard to believe that this story , with terrible dialogue , some bad acting , especially from craig bierko , and scenes that go absolutely nowhere , are actually true .",pos
1,cv183,18612,19,"i know this isn't a true story or anything , but a film should be able to make you think that it is .",pos
1,cv183,18612,20,"on the plus side of acting , we get to see the missing from main character action since the film masterpiece shine in 1995 actor , armin mueller-stahl .",pos
1,cv183,18612,21,"in the thirteenth floor , he is back and is still giving believable and amazing performances .",pos
1,cv183,18612,22,"another plus is gretchen mol's realistic performance , creating her character with depth , not just staying in the one-dimensional phase .",pos
1,cv183,18612,23,"don't expect the intensity of the matrix or existenz to come out of the thirteenth floor , just expect another film that messes with your mind for awhile , and shuts you down like any other movie would .",pos
1,cv183,18612,24,"thrills , chills , and spills aren't what you will get in this film , but you will just get another trip to send your mind on , scrambling it until you've had enough .",pos
1,cv183,18612,25,"the bottom line- let's hope this is the last of the "" reality check "" based movies for awhile .",pos
1,cv184,2673,0,i tried hard not like this movie without succeeding .,pos
1,cv184,2673,1,"it contains parts of bringing up baby , any hepburn/tracy film , part of the plot of war games , cary grant and rosalind russell in his girl friday , elevator shaft action , train action , and murder .",pos
1,cv184,2673,2,"it is cute , funny , suspenseful ( a little bit ) , sexy ( a little bit ) .",pos
1,cv184,2673,3,one of the bad guys was a surprise .,pos
1,cv184,2673,4,"the pace is fast enough , there are some "" action "" scenes .",pos
1,cv184,2673,5,i think that this is a reasonable family summer movie for families with older kids who have already seen maverick .,pos
1,cv184,2673,6,julia roberts and nick nolte are fine separately and together .,pos
1,cv184,2673,7,"i really identified with the julia roberts character ( wishful thinking , i know ! ) , but i do have better hair !",pos
1,cv184,2673,8,"her hair , a very dull dark brown , has no color .",pos
1,cv184,2673,9,she could use some highlights .,pos
1,cv184,2673,10,"they both do fine with their roles : he's a bored columnist with the chicago chronicle and she's a hotshot "" cub "" reporter with the chicago globe .",pos
1,cv184,2673,11,they have great fun trying to out scoop each other to solve one case throughout this movie .,pos
1,cv184,2673,12,i like the one story focus .,pos
1,cv184,2673,13,"other actors include charles martin smith as roberts' boss , olympia dukakis as nolte's coworker , nora dunn also with the chronicle , and marsha mason as a congresswoman .",pos
1,cv184,2673,14,basically this movie is reasonably fun .,pos
1,cv184,2673,15,"there is a serious mystery to solve , and i enjoyed following a fun couple solving the mystery .",pos
1,cv184,2673,16,it is a pleasant change of pace from movies that take themselves seriously .,pos
1,cv184,2673,17,i do give successful comedy high marks .,pos
1,cv185,28654,0,plot : jet li is a chinese cop asked to help some french policemen nab a bad guy .,pos
1,cv185,28654,1,"but one thing leads to another , and the next thing you know , li's being chased by the same french cops with whom he was supposed to be working .",pos
1,cv185,28654,2,"a lot of ass-kicking , face-whippings , gun fights and . . . okay , a little more ass-kicking ensues .",pos
1,cv185,28654,3,critique : very cool !,pos
1,cv185,28654,4,"now here's a movie that gives you exactly what you're looking for , if what you're looking for is kickass action , a palpable good cop/bad cop story line , some hardcore stunts and jet li slam-dunking everyone in sight !",pos
1,cv185,28654,5,"the film also moves fast ( a mere 95 minutes ) , develops a certain "" cute "" chemistry between fonda and li , has nice surroundings ( paris , baby ! ) and gives us one of the best bad guys that i've seen all year .",pos
1,cv185,28654,6,tcheky karyo is the devil incarnate in this film .,pos
1,cv185,28654,7,he is pure evil .,pos
1,cv185,28654,8,they should have called this movie bad lieutenant 2 as keitel has nothing on this man .,pos
1,cv185,28654,9,"what a great , great monster !",pos
1,cv185,28654,10,"my favorite line of tcheky's was when li was explaining the whole "" kiss of the dragon "" thing to him and he cut him off by saying "" kiss my ass ! """,pos
1,cv185,28654,11,pure action movie poetry .,pos
1,cv185,28654,12,"anyway , other than him , jet li also handled his "" acting "" pretty well in this film , with very little real dialogue to say , but enough to make us believe his character .",pos
1,cv185,28654,13,"actually , just looking into the man's eyes generally tells you a lot .",pos
1,cv185,28654,14,"fonda was also pretty good , despite playing one of the most trashy and abused women that i have seen in quite some time , but i still felt kinda bad for her , so i guess she did her job okay .",pos
1,cv185,28654,15,"but in the end , nobody goes to see this kind of movie for oscar performances .",pos
1,cv185,28654,16,"we go to see jet li movies because we want to see jet li kicking a lot of ass from side to side , and this film delivers gangbusters on that front .",pos
1,cv185,28654,17,and yes . . . they have no wire-fu in this movie . . . i,pos
1,cv185,28654,18,say again . . . no,pos
1,cv185,28654,19,"wire-work , no bullshit stunts with li floating around in mid-air for over a minute .",pos
1,cv185,28654,20,"it's all straight action , fist to fist , boot to face and all around cool stunts .",pos
1,cv185,28654,21,"if that's what you're looking for , i don't see how you will be disappointed with this film .",pos
1,cv185,28654,22,"yes , it's not very original in plot ( just take luc besson's own la femme nikita and mix in plenty of his own the professional et voila ! ) , does have an annoying hip-hoppy soundtrack that just got on my nerves after a while ( i also would have gotten rid of the whole acupuncture thang . . . ) and will have anyone not willing to restrain their disbelief , rolling their eyes all over the place .",pos

1,cv185,28654,27,does this sound interesting to you ?,pos
1,cv185,28654,28,"well , the answer to that question is entirely up to you .",pos
1,cv185,28654,29,"one thing that i would definitely recommend is , as jet li pointed out himself on his website , that you leave the kids at home for this one .",pos
1,cv185,28654,30,"in fact , you might even wanna leave yourself if you can't handle the more violent of sequences .",pos

1,cv190,27052,12,"the film is notable in that it takes this very simple story line and creates a complex and intelligent character-driven vehicle filled with well-written dialogue , shades of motivation , and convincing acting by all the actors .",pos

1,cv192,14395,17,"the script is loosely based on john irving's novel , a prayer for owen meany , but it's so far off the source material that irving actually requested the credits be changed from 'based on' to 'suggested by . '",pos
1,cv192,14395,18,"along those same lines , it's almost unfitting to compare the two ; johnson uses tension , humor , atmosphere , and suspense to create an original drama of forrest gumpian proportions .",pos
1,cv192,14395,19,by no means has he developed a project of similar popularity - gump made over 300 million dollars while birch ought to pass out of sight in a few weeks - but the winning idea remains the same .,pos

1,cv193,5416,3,"--scenes of intelligent , amusing dialogue with no relevance to the plot --a story that jumps back and forth in time rather than going in a logical , chronological sequence --graphic yet necessary violence --an engaging crime story --dialogue liberally spiced with swear words and racial/gender slurs --three of the same actors ( harvey keitel , tim roth and steve buscemi ) --a mexican standoff ending , although this one is considerably less optimistic than pf",pos
1,cv193,5416,4,reservoir dogs is an entire hour shorter than pulp fiction because it's only got one story to tell rather than three .,pos
1,cv193,5416,5,crime lord joe cabot ( veteran actor lawrence tierney ) has assembled five criminals who have never even met each other to pull a diamond store heist .,pos
1,cv193,5416,6,the five are instructed not to reveal their real names or personal details or anything the cops could use if one of them was captured and interrogated .,pos

1,cv193,5416,10,"the police had arrived at the scene of the crime way too soon , leading white to believe one of the five was an informant .",pos

1,cv193,5416,12,"eventually , blonde arrives with a police officer hostage , and what follows is a truly brutal , uncomfortable torture scene .",pos
1,cv193,5416,13,let's just say picasso would be inspired by what blonde does to the cop's ear .,pos
1,cv193,5416,14,"a lot of the time , reservoir dogs seems like your typical gangster heist-gone-wrong movie , but there are a few sequences that are uniquely tarantino .",pos
1,cv193,5416,15,"the opening scene in the coffee shop starts the movie off on a high note the rest of it doesn't live up to , as the criminals plus joe have a conversation on , among other things , tipping philosophies and their interpretations of madonna's "" like a virgin . """,pos
1,cv193,5416,16,another scene involves roth's lengthy manufactured story about running into a group of cops and a police dog in a bus station bathroom while carrying a giant bag of marijuana .,pos
1,cv193,5416,17,"neither of these have much plot relevance but are given ample time to develop , like the captain koons gold watch speech in pulp fiction , only here these sequences are more enjoyable than the rest of the movie .",pos
1,cv193,5416,18,reservoir dogs is good but it's no pulp fiction .,pos
1,cv194,12079,0,it's a fact that a good thriller or action movie doesn't need violence to be good or worth watching .,pos
1,cv194,12079,1,all it takes is potential violence to make the audience bite their nails .,pos
1,cv194,12079,2,and what kind of violence could be more efficient than a global thermo-nuclear war ?,pos
1,cv194,12079,3,and potential violence is the premiss wargames is built upon .,pos

1,cv194,12079,9,it was very efficent at giving you a scare in those days and that hasn't changed .,pos
1,cv194,12079,10,"of course , a nuclear war seemed to be much more of something that could actually happen back in 1983 .",pos
1,cv194,12079,11,i wouldn't be surprised if this gave people nightmares .,pos
1,cv194,12079,12,i hope it still does since you still hear about school kids hacking into the computers at pentagon .,pos
1,cv194,12079,13,broderick and sheedy are just fine as the young teenagers ( although her interest in david remains a mystery ) .,pos
1,cv194,12079,14,"but the rest of the actors are , by no fault of their own , restricted by the script to play one-dimensional grownups .",pos
1,cv194,12079,15,"david's parents are the same kind of parents that populate all these college comedies from the 1980s , movies like secret admirer , porky's or zapped and the norad general beringer is straight out of dr . strangelove .",pos

1,cv195,14528,0,there exists a litany of differences between a successful action movie and a successful suspense movie .,pos
1,cv195,14528,1,"action movies are typically devoid of plot other than a simple byline which can string together several explosive sequences , while suspense movies hinge on plot and subtlety and the ability to bring everything full-circle .",pos
1,cv195,14528,2,"for fans of both genres , however , realism is key .",pos
1,cv195,14528,3,"action fans want to know that the weapons and methods their heroes are using are authentic , and suspense fans want everything to fall into an explainable framework by the movie's end .",pos
1,cv195,14528,4,"on this advice , director john frankenheimer ( the island of dr .",pos
1,cv195,14528,5,"moreau ) strives for realism in an interestingly dynamic balance of suspense and action for his latest thriller , ronin .",pos
1,cv195,14528,6,"the depth of intrigue in ronin is quite amazing , considering the fare that's fallen into the same category over the last few years .",pos
1,cv195,14528,7,"the script , written by j . d . zeik in his big-screen debut , approaches levels of complexity that had people spinning away from mission : impossible two years ago .",pos
1,cv195,14528,8,"a certain number of people will be lost by this , but afficianados will appreciate it all the more and return multiple times .",pos
1,cv195,14528,9,"frankenheimer masters the script with poise , and tells us a dark but stoically realistic tale of a group of post-cold war mercenaries working to earn their paycheck .",pos
1,cv195,14528,10,"his ability to convey feeling and character while promoting explosiveness and tense atmosphere works well here , and ronin becomes a better movie because of it .",pos
1,cv195,14528,11,robert de niro headlines this cast of noteworthies in a performance that is the most outstanding of his in quite some time .,pos
1,cv195,14528,12,"he takes command and offers much gravity as the ex-spy sam , a man who's called to france to help a shady operations controller named dierdre ( natascha mcelhone ) recover a package .",pos
1,cv195,14528,13,"the package becomes the central motivator for the entire cast , especially once the requisite double-crossing begins , and its role is skillfully penned by zeik .",pos
1,cv195,14528,14,"at times , however , zeik's tale becomes almost too reminiscent of mission : impossible - de niro might easily become tom cruise , the package might become cruise's computer disk .",pos
1,cv195,14528,15,"fortunately , the focus here is almost entirely on the package , whereas in mission the script was more concerned with the double-cross and why it happened .",pos
1,cv195,14528,16,"the action content is impressive , and it lives up to the hints given in previews .",pos
1,cv195,14528,17,the only fans who will be disappointed are those who expect full-blown combat scenes and instead are forced to suffer through moments of slowness .,pos
1,cv195,14528,18,"ronin does take a degree of intelligence to follow all of the nuance from start to finish , but even the uninitiated will be able to keep a grasp on most characters mand subplots .",pos
1,cv195,14528,19,"the suspense tapers off considerably by the end , a bit of a drawback because of its height at the movie's open .",pos
1,cv195,14528,20,"considering these factors it's good to see that ronin was a project that turned out well , and it's another good bet this month .",pos

2,cv202,10654,7,"fortunately , i turned out to be wrong .",pos
2,cv202,10654,8,"for one thing , spielberg's camera never once gets near a southern plantation and instead sticks to the slave ships and the slave traders' operations in africa , so "" amistad "" was dealing with a different part of the history of slavery from the very beginning .",pos
2,cv202,10654,9,"and some of the images here are , in fact , much more harrowing than what we usually see in movies about slavery .",pos
2,cv202,10654,10,"one scene in the middle , in which the crew of a slave ship dispose of some of their "" excess "" slaves by throwing them overboard to drown , has to be one of the most disturbing film images of the year .",pos
2,cv202,10654,11,"spielberg digs farther into the evils of slavery than i was expecting he would , and in fact he probably goes about as far as a movie director can without getting an nc-17 rating .",pos
2,cv202,10654,12,"the stark suffering of the africans is contrasted sharply with the shallow luxury of the politicians , such as president van buren and queen isabella of spain , whose naval officers were involved in the legal dispute and who was only a small child at the time .",pos
2,cv202,10654,13,"exposing politicians as narrow-minded , opportunistic hypocrites is fairly standard stuff , of course , but spielberg and writer david franzoni do it well enough that it still comes off as something more than just a simple exercise in audience manipulation .",pos
2,cv202,10654,14,"the film also examines the contentious nature of the slavery issue at the time , such that john quincy adams ( and probably other politicians like him ) , who clearly disapproved of the practice , was reluctant to get involved in the case until it was appealed all the way to the supreme court .",pos
2,cv202,10654,15,"the biggest success of "" amistad "" is probably the characterization of cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , who emerges as the de facto leader of the kidnapped africans and struggles to communicate with baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , the lawyer who represents them in court .",pos
2,cv202,10654,16,"through cinque , we are given a window into the native culture , as he and the displaced africans try to explain to the prison guards what they need for a proper burial of a dead tribe member , or find an illustrated version of the bible and try to understand the story of jesus christ .",pos
2,cv202,10654,17,"cinque sees the dispute with a clarity and simplicity that , again , contrasts with the technicalities and mechanics of the legal process and of the political squabbles .",pos

2,cv202,10654,19,"spielberg's direction tends a little bit towards the manipulative side at times , such as when he adds a heavy orchestral swell to cinque's angry outburst in the court room .",pos
2,cv202,10654,20,"still , there isn't enough of this for it to be a serious problem .",pos
2,cv202,10654,21,"the main flaw in this film , which prevents it from earning four stars , is that it seems like spielberg and franzoni can't quite handle all of these issues at the same time , so instead they settle for addressing each one separately and simply editing the results into the same movie .",pos
2,cv202,10654,22,"this summer's contact , for example , dealt with several issues at once , but each of them was somehow present in almost every scene and , most importantly , all of them were resolved at once .",pos
2,cv202,10654,23,""" amistad "" tries to pull it all together in the end with a speech from adams , but it somehow feels a little forced , and in any case the speech itself , which lasts almost fifteen minutes , wears out its welcome about halfway through .",pos

2,cv205,9457,18,"her eligibility for the spot failed when she is questioned on her beliefs in the existence of god by the president's spiritual advisor ( mcconaughey ) ; allie , being an atheist , a result of her belief in fact and science , refuses to budge upon questioning .",pos
2,cv205,9457,19,at this point the movie plot thickens considerably as she is romantically involved with the president's spiritual advisor .,pos
2,cv205,9457,20,a strong point which propelled the movie is the depth of its main characters played by foster and mcconaughey .,pos
2,cv205,9457,21,"from the very first meeting scene , it is obvious that the two of them was sort of kindred spirits but they were worlds apart in almost all aspects , foster being a person drawn to science and facts and mcconaughey being one who believes in faith , hope and the power of the unseen .",pos

2,cv205,9457,23,"many people who read the synopsis of this film would find it a tad too ridiculous , but by actually immersing yourself in it , gives you an entirely different perspective ; one which is free from bias and pre-conceptions .",pos

2,cv206,14293,12,what's most amazing is that all this success is in spite of a severe lack of originality .,pos
2,cv206,14293,13,"you see , disney animated features these days have two components : theme and plot .",pos
2,cv206,14293,14,the theme changes with each new movie ; the plot does not .,pos
2,cv206,14293,15,"the plot is a mold into which the characters of some ancient fable are dropped , and try as they might to rise above the characters of previous features , they are nearly always destined to do no more than the same .",pos
2,cv206,14293,16,"however , while the success of a disney animated feature is generally a given as far as box-office receipts , merchandising dollars , and glimmers in the eyes of little children , critically they are as varied as anything else that hollywood has to offer .",pos
2,cv206,14293,17,"luckily , disney's latest animated offering , mulan , manages to be engaging and refreshing , even while rife with formula .",pos
2,cv206,14293,18,"the film starts with the invasion of ancient china by the huns , led by the imposing shan-yu ( miguel ferrer ) .",pos
2,cv206,14293,19,"soon , china's emperor ( pat morita ) mobilizes his armies and decrees that one male from each family in the country shall serve to fight in china's defense .",pos

2,cv206,14293,22,"mulan , based on a chinese epic poem , is a classic tale of the triumph of the ugly duckling .",pos
2,cv206,14293,23,"mulan herself is a disgrace to her loving family , as she has a difficult time fitting into the traditional woman's role , and in a very amusing scene where a matchmaker attempts to assess her value to a potential husband , we see that "" grace "" is not one of her strong points .",pos
2,cv206,14293,24,"very early on , we are presented with the high importance of bringing honor to one's family , and by botching her chance at gaining the favor of the matchmaker , mulan fails at that task .",pos
2,cv206,14293,25,"by leaving home to fight in her father's place , she may not only spare his life , but bring honor , too .",pos
2,cv206,14293,26,"as is the case with most disney musicals , the songs are first rate and pervasive throughout the film .",pos
2,cv206,14293,27,"i'm not sure if they will get much airplay , but at least one of the songs will no doubt receive recognition come oscar time .",pos
2,cv206,14293,28,"both lea salonga , who provides the singing voice for mulan , and donny osmond who sings for shang , the captain of mulan's army unit and obligatory love interest , are more than competent , although salonga's voice translates much better to animation .",pos
2,cv206,14293,29,you have to hear it to understand .,pos
2,cv206,14293,30,"interestingly , the musical numbers which are so often done with big flourishes are surprisingly muted in mulan .",pos
2,cv206,14293,31,"there is no significantly big number , which is customary as the second or third song in a disney film , but this does not detract significantly from the rest of the movie .",pos
2,cv206,14293,32,"it is , however , an expectation which has been built by disney's own formulaic history , and some viewers may feel as if something is missing .",pos
2,cv206,14293,33,"artistically , the animators have chosen to adopt the more subdued pastels of chinese artwork , and although this may not live up to the vibrance so associated with many of the other disney works , it helps to contribute a more authentic , and therefore more credible , nature to what otherwise may be seen as a typically "" disneyfied "" ethnic tale .",pos
2,cv206,14293,34,"there are also a couple of visually standout scenes , one involving the charge of shan-yu's hun army , which utilizes the same computer-enhanced imagery disney animators have employed since the chandelier in beauty and the beast .",pos
2,cv206,14293,35,the other scene worth mentioning is so quick you might miss it .,pos
2,cv206,14293,36,"when mulan resolves to take her father's place , she dons her father's old battle armor , and unsheathes a sword .",pos
2,cv206,14293,37,"as she does so , you can see her reflection in the polished metal .",pos
2,cv206,14293,38,"it just left me thinking , "" that was really cool . """,pos
2,cv206,14293,39,"a wonderful range of performances delight the audience throughout the film , varying from the straight , such as soon-tek oh as fa zhou , to the comical , such as harvey fierstein as yao , a gruff , pugilistic member of shang's conscripted army .",pos
2,cv206,14293,40,"even more outrageous is eddie murphy as mushu , the diminutive guardian dragon sent to look after mulan .",pos
2,cv206,14293,41,"although an obvious attempt to relive the chemistry brought forth by robin williams in aladdin , murphy nevertheless distinguishes himself with his own winning performance .",pos

2,cv206,14293,44,"in any event , wong performs admirably as well .",pos
2,cv206,14293,45,one character which provides a significant amount of humor is grandmother fa .,pos
2,cv206,14293,46,"she deserves recognition not only because of the levity she brings to the movie , but also because she is voiced by two very remarkable people .",pos
2,cv206,14293,47,"june foray , who supplies grandmother fa's speaking voice , is a venerable voice actress who may be best known for her work as rocky the squirrel and natasha fatale ( as in boris and natasha ) .",pos

2,cv206,14293,49,"with this in mind , hearing grandmother fa is like listening to a little piece of history .",pos
2,cv206,14293,50,mulan is the latest disney animated feature to get away from some of the eurocentrism which for so long dominated disney films .,pos
2,cv206,14293,51,"in an effort to be culturally sensitive ( and to avoid a "" miss saigon "" -type debacle ) , disney has also wisely chosen to employ many asian-american actors for both lead and supporting roles .",pos
2,cv206,14293,52,"in addition to the actors already mentioned , the cast includes such ubiquitous talents as james hong , gedde watanabe , james shigeta , and george takei .",pos

2,cv211,9953,3,"instead of being a suspense/science fiction film , cameron alters the series and changing it into an action picture .",pos
2,cv211,9953,4,what results is one of the most terrifying films ever created .,pos
2,cv211,9953,5,"a film like aliens comes along only once in a while , and when it does , audiences are usually unprepared for it .",pos
2,cv211,9953,6,"i never saw this movie in theaters , but i wish i could have .",pos
2,cv211,9953,7,"the terror and fright must have been unimaginable , most likely with audiences members literally shrieking in fear .",pos
2,cv211,9953,8,aliens is an action film unlike any i have ever seen .,pos
2,cv211,9953,9,"with a science fiction plot , cameron gives aliens added testosterone , pumping up the action and fire power from the original film .",pos
2,cv211,9953,10,"in fact , aliens is one of those few sequels which tops the original .",pos
2,cv211,9953,11,"perhaps what makes the alien series so impressive is the hero--or heroine , as the case may be .",pos
2,cv211,9953,12,"never have we had a more sympathetic hero in an action film , and never have i seen such an impressive acting job done by the main character .",pos
2,cv211,9953,13,sigourney weaver is possibly the only actress who could play this character and make her realistic enough for us to care about .,pos
2,cv211,9953,14,"placing a woman in these situations would sometimes seem unusual , but because of weaver's presence , a woman is the only suitable hero .",pos
2,cv211,9953,15,aliens begins 57 years after alien ended .,pos
2,cv211,9953,16,lieutenant ellen ripley ( weaver ) is discovered in hypersleep on the nostromo and is awakened .,pos
2,cv211,9953,17,"she explains how she is the only survivor of her past encounter with the aliens , but "" the company "" is doubtful .",pos

2,cv211,9953,19,"despite stern warnings from ripley , the company remains rigid and won't call the families back .",pos
2,cv211,9953,20,"however , when the company loses contact with the colony , ripley's story seems much more feasible .",pos
2,cv211,9953,21,"one of the company's directors , carter burke ( paul reiser ) , wants to gather a team to travel to the planet .",pos
2,cv211,9953,22,"this team includes a buff private vasquez ( jenette goldstein ) , a questionable corporal hicks ( michael biehn ) , and a loyal android bishop ( lance henriksen ) .",pos

2,cv211,9953,24,"arriving on the planet , the team finds most of the human life extinguished in a cocoon-type environment .",pos

2,cv211,9953,26,"ripley finds this a chance to be the mother she never had the opportunity to become , and she becomes newt's surrogate mother .",pos
2,cv211,9953,27,"ripley and newt are the only ones who knows what has happened , and soon , all hell breaks loose .",pos
2,cv211,9953,28,"aliens not only multiplies the thrills and suspense from scott's version , it also multiplies the number of aliens in general .",pos
2,cv211,9953,29,"alien focused on one alien in particular which systematically killed each crew member , except ripley , who managed to jettison the alien out of the nostromo .",pos
2,cv211,9953,30,"aliens focuses on an entire race of these aliens , and as a result , the chills are incredibly heightened .",pos
2,cv211,9953,31,"then again , this is james cameron , the guy who has given us true lies and terminator 2 : judgment day .",pos
2,cv211,9953,32,"he is the best action director out there ( topping renny harlin , who directed cliffhanger ) , and only he could create something as terrifying as this film .",pos
2,cv211,9953,33,"it seems that every alien film seems to have some memorable scene or scenes , and aliens has the motherload .",pos
2,cv211,9953,34,"with perhaps one of the most astonishing endings ever created for an action film , aliens climax never seems to hit until the viewer is nearly pushed to extreme exhaustion .",pos
2,cv211,9953,35,"i can't recall another film ever to sustain this level of intensity throughout , never dropping for a moment .",pos
2,cv211,9953,36,"just when you think the movie is over , something else will occur , and it starts right back up again .",pos
2,cv211,9953,37,"with a seemingly endless conclusion , aliens ends with one of the greatest moments in film history .",pos
2,cv211,9953,38,"this scene is usually the one remembered most from the film , as lieutenant ripley steps into one of the lifting machines to fight the alien queen .",pos
2,cv211,9953,39,"using flawless special effects , the climax is exhausting , leaving any audience member drained from extreme anxiety .",pos
2,cv211,9953,40,"of course , for a film of this genre to work properly , the technical aspects must be realistic enough for us to believe what we see .",pos
2,cv211,9953,41,"aliens is completely realistic , even a decade after its initial release .",pos
2,cv211,9953,42,"the special effects are wonderfully seamless , with a terrifying alien to go with them .",pos
2,cv211,9953,43,"one of the most overlooked aspects of this film is the music , composed by cameron-regular james horner .",pos
2,cv211,9953,44,"horner has created a terrific score , receiving an oscar nomination for his work .",pos
2,cv211,9953,45,"not only that , horner has also created one of the best scores for any action film , or science fiction film ever ( and that includes 2001 : a space odyssey , which was mainly a compilation of well-known composers ) .",pos
2,cv211,9953,46,"in fact , the climax music is also some of the most recognized of film music .",pos
2,cv211,9953,47,"the production design is incredible , which also happened to snag a nomination from the academy .",pos
2,cv211,9953,48,"dark corridors lit by red lights are very impressive , but more impressive is the amount of terror which arises from well-lit locations .",pos
2,cv211,9953,49,normally a film will be very dark in order to scare a viewer ; aliens uses lights to scare the viewer .,pos
2,cv211,9953,50,"then , of course , is the cinematography , which uses point of view shots , along with video feeds in order to build suspense .",pos
2,cv211,9953,51,some of the scariest scenes involve the perspective of ripley .,pos
2,cv211,9953,52,"surprisingly , the acting is not only above average for this genre , but some of the best .",pos
2,cv211,9953,53,"sigourney weaver received an oscar nomination for her portrayal of ripley , incorporating the right amount of sympathy into her hard-edged persona .",pos
2,cv211,9953,54,"weaver soars above the rest in this film , but she is supposed to .",pos
2,cv211,9953,55,"carrie henn gives an above average performance for a child , developing a three-dimensional character from her quiet attitude .",pos
2,cv211,9953,56,"lance henriksen is terrific as bishop , showing that androids don't always have to be flat characters .",pos
2,cv211,9953,57,"jenette goldstein shows a fair amount of enthusiasm with her role , and steals several scenes of her own ( though her personality becomes slightly annoying when she isn't fighting ) .",pos
2,cv211,9953,58,michael biehn gives a very nice performance in the most obligatory role of the film .,pos
2,cv211,9953,59,"however , biehn does a good job , making it seem original again .",pos
2,cv211,9953,60,"paul reiser may seem like an odd choice to play the sleazy corporate director , but reiser manages to pull it off quite well ( however , i still see him as paul on tv's "" mad about you "" ) .",pos
2,cv211,9953,61,"a very good cast ( which also includes bill paxton and william hope ) highlights this action film , making it stand out from others .",pos
2,cv211,9953,62,"aliens is rightfully rated r for violence , gore , language , and terror .",pos
2,cv211,9953,63,"aliens is sort of the redefining moment of the science fiction genre , as alien was more of a suspense/horror film .",pos
2,cv211,9953,64,"aliens pumps up the stakes , and cameron directs it with professional quality .",pos
2,cv211,9953,65,"cameron certainly knows how to make a good action film , but here he proves how he can create some truly horrific moments on screen .",pos
2,cv211,9953,66,"technically astonishing , aliens' only flaw is small characters who are only there to get killed .",pos
2,cv211,9953,67,"aside from this , you probably won't experience anything like aliens for quite a while .",pos

2,cv212,10027,2,"rudy's girlfriend is attacked by her violent husband ; rudy's elderly landlady wants to arrange her will so that her children are excluded , and ; the family of rudy's friend with leukemia is suing the corrupt insurance company that wouldn't pay for a bone marrow transplant .",pos
2,cv212,10027,3,"rudy is new to being a lawyer and is thoroughly outgunned , but luckily he is aided by a sleazy ambulance chaser ( danny devito ) who has failed the bar exam six times as well as by the kindly presiding judge ( danny glover ) .",pos

2,cv212,10027,6,will he enjoy being a lawyer ?,pos
2,cv212,10027,7,"opinion : the good news is that this movie has a happy ending , and it features a guy trying to do the right thing .",pos
2,cv212,10027,8,director francis ford coppola does this film a little differently than the stereotypical law movie .,pos
2,cv212,10027,9,"in the typical lawyer movie there's one big case and the movie focuses on solving it , and somewhere along the line surprise witnesses and motives turn up before the good guy wins ( after lots of gripping courtroom drama ) .",pos
2,cv212,10027,10,"however , coppola's movie is deliberately more low key .",pos
2,cv212,10027,11,'the rainmaker' plays out like a personality sketch of young rudy as he gets emotionally involved with and tries to save various little quirky side characters .,pos
2,cv212,10027,12,in the background rudy's voice narrates his feelings and makes half-cynical jokes about the legal profession in general .,pos
2,cv212,10027,13,two factors combine to make this movie less heavy than it can be .,pos
2,cv212,10027,14,"first , rudy's time is split juggling three cases , rather than concentrating on a single high-stakes case .",pos
2,cv212,10027,15,"also , rudy's use of voice narration in place of acting makes the film lose some of its dramatic edge .",pos
2,cv212,10027,16,"the end result is an entertaining low key law movie where the good guys win , and rudy narrates his way into coming of age .",pos
2,cv213,18934,0,"in one of my many videos i have attained from the local library , casablanca was my third classic in some weeks .",pos
2,cv213,18934,1,"the others being citizen kane and vertigo ( yes , i am trying to see as many of afi's greatest movies ever made as i can ) .",pos
2,cv213,18934,2,"but , casablanca stood out from the rest for me : it was actually watchable .",pos
2,cv213,18934,3,"what most hail as the greatest american film ever , casablanca isn't so much a love story as a political frenzy with a love triangle thrown in .",pos
2,cv213,18934,4,it seems that star humphry bogart spend about 85 percent of the movie with various leaders of the nation instead of with ingred bergman .,pos
2,cv213,18934,5,"that annoyed me , as did the ending .",pos
2,cv213,18934,6,why didn't the plan turn around ? ! ?,pos
2,cv213,18934,7,"surprisingly , i enjoyed the film .",pos

2,cv213,18934,9,"i once read about if you had a choice to be in a movie , which one would it be , and a women said casablanca .",pos
2,cv213,18934,10,"at first i was thinking to myself "" why ? """,pos
2,cv213,18934,11,"then , as i watched the film again , i understood why .",pos
2,cv213,18934,12,"the movie is very well done and the script top-notch , although i doubt i understood more than half of the political mumbo jumbo .",pos
2,cv213,18934,13,"casablanca is , in my mind , no classic ( like solaris ) , but it is a good film and stylishly shot .",pos
2,cv213,18934,14,"hey , hollywood , how about this : a remake with harrison ford and anne heche ?",pos
2,cv213,18934,15,now that would be a classic .,pos

2,cv214,12294,7,"advertised as a quirky comedy with hints of action , it turned out to have a suprising dosage of it .",pos
2,cv214,12294,8,the big hit is quite the opposite .,pos
2,cv214,12294,9,"it was hyped as "" the new film from producer john woo "" , so one would it expect lots of stylized killing and action .",pos
2,cv214,12294,10,"however , there's a sore lack of it , which is about the only thing wrong with the big hit .",pos
2,cv214,12294,11,the film starts out with mel smiley and his cohorts doing a job on a white slaver .,pos
2,cv214,12294,12,"mel , played by mark wahlberg in a dopey , milquetoast role , is a killing machine ; he flips , spins , even breakdances whilst popping caps .",pos
2,cv214,12294,13,"sadly , he doesn't get a chance to do much of it .",pos
2,cv214,12294,14,"except for the beginning set piece and the last 20 twenty minutes or so , the film is in comedy mode .",pos
2,cv214,12294,15,"the action , at least what there is of it , is prime cut stuff .",pos
2,cv214,12294,16,"wong , after numerous hong kong features , makes quite a nice u . s . debut .",pos
2,cv214,12294,17,"however , his pacing is a bit off , with the action sequences only bookending the movie and not lasting long enough .",pos
2,cv214,12294,18,"they start off electrifying and fresh , but just kinda stop .",pos
2,cv214,12294,19,"normally , this would hamper a movie to the point of being unenjoyable .",pos
2,cv214,12294,20,"luckily , we have ben ramsey's screenplay , a bitingly funny piece of work .",pos
2,cv214,12294,21,"the only problem is there might be too much humor , one joke makes you laugh so hard you miss the next few .",pos
2,cv214,12294,22,some of best gags include an oriental film maker down on his luck and one of mel's hitmen pals that has just discovered onanism .,pos
2,cv214,12294,23,"the only problem is how some of the minor characters are handled , some being there only for a laugh , which sometimes works , sometimes doesn't .",pos
2,cv214,12294,24,"overall , the big hit may have it's flaws , but it makes up for them in a stylishly directed , gut-wrenchingly funny joyride .",pos

2,cv217,28842,5,"this fable about home and family is a major debut for first-time film-maker thomas bezucha ( a former designer for coach and polo/ralph lauren ) who is meticulous about minding details , using ballads like "" welcome to my world "" and "" achin' , breakin' heart "" to set up the concept of our universal longing to find a place in which we can love and be loved .",pos
2,cv217,28842,6,"in the paradise of big eden , what you are doesn't matter as much as generosity of spirit , respect and kindness .",pos
2,cv217,28842,7,"sure , the plot's implausible but it's a good-natured fantasy so allowances should be made .",pos

2,cv220,29059,8,"that being said , _the caveman's valentine_ can only really succeed as a heroic fantasy , a frank miller graphic novel that has the audacity to portray the blood staining a field of virgin snow expanding to form the shape of a heart .",pos
2,cv220,29059,9,"the difficulties with the film spring from the misunderstanding that it somehow adheres to the conventions of a thriller or a police procedural when , in fact , _the caveman's valentine_ is a superhero fable that takes on the cause of the homeless ( again like mcfarlane's spawn ) while attacking the entrenched ruling classes in government and the arts .",pos

2,cv224,17661,42,"the ending works very well , and left it very open to the sequels that came afterward .",pos

2,cv224,17661,44,the film was re-mastered so it looked better than it did in 1977 .,pos
2,cv224,17661,45,"a few creatures were added here and there , and even an entire deleted scene with han solo and jabba the hutt ( seen in return of the jedi ) was added to the film .",pos

2,cv225,29224,2,"and while the film fits neatly into the low-brow , slapstick school of comedy , one refreshing aspect is its lack of mean-spiritedness .",pos
2,cv225,29224,3,"the plot follows a group of people chosen at random by an eccentric las vegas casino owner ( john cleese ) who must race from vegas to a bus station locker 700 miles away in silver city , n . m .",pos

2,cv225,29224,8,various amusing encounters and mishaps befall the participants en route to silver city .,pos
2,cv225,29224,9,screenwriter andy breckman adds a nice touch by not having the racers try to sabotage one another .,pos
2,cv225,29224,10,"the most side-splitting situations involve vera and merrill's encounter with the squirrel lady , a nice nutsy cameo by kathy bates ; owen's commandeering a charter bus full of lucille ball look-alikes on their way to a lucy convention ; the cody brothers misadventures with a hot-air balloon , a flying cow and a monster truck ; and the pear family's stopover at a barbie museum , which turns out not to be what they think it is .",pos
2,cv225,29224,11,the pear family situation is a fine example of the way breckman's script builds the laughs .,pos
2,cv225,29224,12,"without going into detail , this bit segues from the museum to hitler's touring car , to eva braun's dark lipstick , to lovitz burning his tongue , culminating at a ceremony honoring world war ii veterans .",pos

2,cv225,29224,15,"the film is directed by jerry zucker , who knows something about comedy .",pos

2,cv225,29224,19,this is a fun little feature .,pos
2,cv225,29224,20,"the only letdown comes at the finale , which is too touchy-feely and sweet , almost negating what came before it .",pos

2,cv226,2618,0,i had a chance to see a sneak preview of city slickers ii on campus last night .,pos
2,cv226,2618,1,i went in with the expectation of a film with the similar flavor which made the original such a success : personal growth and insightful humor about life .,pos
2,cv226,2618,2,"i came away somewhat disappointed in this regard , getting some of the latter and not much of the former .",pos
2,cv226,2618,3,"the basic plot revolves around billy crystal , who plays mitch robbins , turning forty .",pos
2,cv226,2618,4,he's now become the station manager of the radio station in which he worked in the original .,pos

2,cv226,2618,9,"on the way , they run into curly's twin brother , duke , played by ( you know who ) jack palance .",pos
2,cv226,2618,10,"first of all , the cinematography was beautifully done , especially the outdoor scenes in the desert .",pos
2,cv226,2618,11,the scenes are such that i would like to see some of those sights filmed myself .,pos
2,cv226,2618,12,there is some character development during the film .,pos
2,cv226,2618,13,"the actors remain true to their characters and play them well , without overplaying the jokes .",pos
2,cv226,2618,14,"the movie is a good basic adventure , with enough plot twists to provide for an ending that is difficult to predict .",pos
2,cv226,2618,15,"the movie is paced well , but with a couple slow spots in the middle and towards the end .",pos
2,cv226,2618,16,"humor-wise , the film has a good number of jokes which maintained my interest throughout the film .",pos
2,cv226,2618,17,"there are memorable moments like when stern is bitten by a snake , but there are fewer jokes to laugh at in the sequel ( surprise , surprise for a sequel , right ? ) .",pos
2,cv226,2618,18,"however , the slight bitter aftertaste i have with this film has to do mainly with the film's manipulation of the audience .",pos
2,cv226,2618,19,"the film tries to pull your heart-strings too much regarding how close the characters are to each other , like when mitch had decided to suck the snake marrow out of his best friend's butt .",pos
2,cv226,2618,20,this is done again when the gang meets up with some members of the cattle drive group from the original .,pos
2,cv226,2618,21,"there were also some parts which appeared unrealistic , like whether the stampede would start in the way it did or why they didn't worry more about water while tromping around the desert .",pos
2,cv226,2618,22,some strenuous stretches of the imagination are required here .,pos
2,cv226,2618,23,"since the objective of the gang is to find gold and get rich ( unlike finding themselves in middle age like in the original ) , i also found it harder to empathize with the characters during their journey .",pos
2,cv226,2618,24,"overall , i'd say that the film is an entertaining and humorous adventure with some story-line deficiencies making it less worthy than the original .",pos
2,cv226,2618,25,"it may be worth the full price of admission , but a matinee would be a better bargain .",pos
2,cv227,24215,0,"the "" submarine "" genre of movies seems to be one of the most intriguing and compelling types of storytelling there is .",pos
2,cv227,24215,1,think about it . . .,pos
2,cv227,24215,2,"these films are completely based in reality , yet only a handful of people have ever been on one , making them fascinating to the general public .",pos
2,cv227,24215,3,"they aren't like movies that take place on a plane or a train , as anybody can get on one of those .",pos
2,cv227,24215,4,"and they aren't like movies that happen in outer space either , because no one's done any of that stuff yet .",pos
2,cv227,24215,5,"when a new one comes out , you don't hear anyone say "" ugh , another submarine movie "" like people tend to say "" ugh , another boxing movie "" .",pos
2,cv227,24215,6,"look at modern movies that involve submarines : das boot , the abyss , the hunt for red october , crimson tide . . .",pos
2,cv227,24215,7,all are well regarded as top-notch entertainment .,pos
2,cv227,24215,8,"gladly joining that bunch is u-571 , which stars matthew mcconaughey as the executive officer of a u . s . naval submarine during world war ii .",pos
2,cv227,24215,9,we learn he has been denied a recommendation for his own command by his superior ( bill paxton ) .,pos
2,cv227,24215,10,"mcconaughey's crew then receives orders that they will be boarding a disabled german submarine to steal the enigma , a german communications encoding device that has stumped allied intelligence .",pos
2,cv227,24215,11,"the mission goes horribly wrong however , and as a result , mcconaughey and only a handful of his crew ( as well as a captured german ) become trapped aboard the u-571 in enemy waters .",pos
2,cv227,24215,12,the first great thing about u-571 is the film's opening sequence .,pos
2,cv227,24215,13,"the german crew of u-571 are under attack , which sets the events of the rest of the film into motion .",pos
2,cv227,24215,14,"it's tense , exciting and fascinating .",pos
2,cv227,24215,15,and i applaud the filmmakers for not copping out and instead keeping the entire sequence in german with english subtitles .,pos
2,cv227,24215,16,most movies with a scene this long would have panicked and had the german crew speaking english right away .,pos
2,cv227,24215,17,"once the plot gets moving , u-571 gives us action sequence after action sequence , making the audience wonder "" ok , now how do they get out of this ? "" .",pos
2,cv227,24215,18,"the stakes keep raising ( much like in executive decision , an excellent action-thriller ) , and even though the audience knows how the film will end , it's a lot of fun getting there .",pos
2,cv227,24215,19,i only have two minor complaints about the entire film .,pos
2,cv227,24215,20,the first comes from the scenes which follow the opening sequence .,pos
2,cv227,24215,21,"while their purpose is to introduce us to the characters and to get the story going ( which they do ) , i feel as though it could have been done much quicker , and less conventionally .",pos
2,cv227,24215,22,"i mean , did we really have to see the ship's crew at a wedding ?",pos
2,cv227,24215,23,"because of that , you now know exactly what's going to happen to the groom !",pos
2,cv227,24215,24,my other gripe would be during the film's finale .,pos
2,cv227,24215,25,there's an explosion which ends the film that is one of the weakest looking cgi effects since the president's plane crashed into the ocean at the end of air force one .,pos
2,cv227,24215,26,i cannot stress this enough . . .,pos
2,cv227,24215,27,"until a cgi effect can be made to look like a model effect , stick with using models .",pos
2,cv227,24215,28,"yes , u-571 is historically incorrect and there are surely some specifics in the plot that people who have been onboard a submarine will tell you "" that couldn't happen "" , but the overall point of this film is entertainment .",pos
2,cv227,24215,29,it succeeds fantastically .,pos
2,cv227,24215,30,[pg-13],pos
2,cv228,5806,0,we share the descent into darkness of a talented boy pianist .,pos
2,cv228,5806,1,years later we see his subsequent resurfacing ; in the mid 80's a damaged man walks out of a rainstorm and back into the world .,pos
2,cv228,5806,2,the movie charts the causes of his mental breakdown .,pos
2,cv228,5806,3,"based on the life story of david helfgott , this australian film is a rich exploration of the pressures drilling in upon a child-genius , compounded by the looming shadow of a domineering father .",pos
2,cv228,5806,4,in the 1950's helfgott emerged as a child prodigy .,pos
2,cv228,5806,5,"the film traces his relationship with his father , whose encouragement comes at the cost of demanding david have no life beyond that of the black and white keys .",pos
2,cv228,5806,6,"david is offered places in the usa , but his father refuses to let him leave australia .",pos
2,cv228,5806,7,the effect this has upon helfgott is cleverly told via a single reverse tracked shot ; david is sobbing on the front doorway of his music teacher's house .,pos
2,cv228,5806,8,he is well lit via the external house lights .,pos
2,cv228,5806,9,his teacher isn't home .,pos
2,cv228,5806,10,we pull back and see that the dark front room's window has it's curtains open .,pos
2,cv228,5806,11,"there , in a pool of blackness , is a grand piano .",pos
2,cv228,5806,12,david's fall over the dark cliff has begun .,pos
2,cv228,5806,13,"instead of being told in a linear mode , shine jumps around in time , ala "" pulp fiction "" .",pos
2,cv228,5806,14,"this narrative device works well ; we see david as a boy , teenager in london and mental-patient in various snippets .",pos
2,cv228,5806,15,the film then neatly loops back for its uplifting conclusion .,pos
2,cv228,5806,16,adult-helfgott's return to the light is told in linear fashion .,pos
2,cv228,5806,17,"the lead role is played by 3 different actors , with the teenage-david ( taylor ) and adult-david ( rush ) standing out .",pos
2,cv228,5806,18,"whilst rush is known for his tv work in australia , i think this is his first major cinema work .",pos
2,cv228,5806,19,"his david , whilst clearly damaged - he keeps quoting his "" daddy "" in a babbling word torrent , cuddles strangers and grabs women on the breasts - is both touching and funny .",pos
2,cv228,5806,20,taylor's teenage-david is the more sympathy producing role .,pos
2,cv228,5806,21,we are mute witness to his gradual breakdown as the pressures just keep on building .,pos
2,cv228,5806,22,"his father wants him to play the very demanding rachmaninov's 3rd , whilst his teacher wants to start him with a simple mozart .",pos
2,cv228,5806,23,technically this is a beautiful film and a lot of thought has gone in to the production .,pos
2,cv228,5806,24,i particularly like the use of slow motion and sound effects .,pos
2,cv228,5806,25,one scene has adult-helfgott happily babbling in a car in the rain .,pos
2,cv228,5806,26,the sound of the windshield wipers fades up over his voice .,pos
2,cv228,5806,27,"with a clever subtlety , the wiper sound appears to morph into a rhythmic thumping , but of the same beat .",pos
2,cv228,5806,28,the image dissolves and we realise the thumping is the slow motion applause of a crowd .,pos
2,cv228,5806,29,but it's us being clapped .,pos
2,cv228,5806,30,we are young-david walking up to the stage for our first public show .,pos
2,cv228,5806,31,"the music , as you would expect from a film of this subject matter , is critical .",pos
2,cv228,5806,32,and it works very well .,pos
2,cv228,5806,33,the 'miming' of the actors piano playing is faultless ( apparently rush didn't mime ; he really did play ),pos
2,cv228,5806,34,helfgott's life is certainly not without it's sympathetic people .,pos
2,cv228,5806,35,indeed his return to the 'normal' world is accelerated by his chance meetings with two very special women .,pos
2,cv228,5806,36,his ultimately uplifting story is a magic piece of theatre craft .,pos
2,cv228,5806,37,it shows that with the 'help of god' we can all find our way back home .,pos
2,cv229,13611,0,"today , war became a reality to me after seeing a screening of saving priivate ryan .",pos
2,cv229,13611,1,steve spielberg goes beyond reality with his latest production .,pos
2,cv229,13611,2,the audience is tossed about the theatre witnessing the horror of war .,pos

2,cv229,13611,4,"tom hanks is stunning as capt john miller , set out in france during ww ii to rescue and return home a soldier , private ryan ( matt damon ) who lost three brothers in the war .",pos
2,cv229,13611,5,spielberg at time takes us inside the heads of these individuals as they face death during the horrific battle scenes .,pos
2,cv229,13611,6,"private ryan is not for everyone , but i felt the time was right for a movie like this to be made .",pos
2,cv229,13611,7,the movie reminds us of the sacrifices made by our ww ii fighting men and women .,pos
2,cv229,13611,8,"we must not ever forget them as many gave the ultimate sacrifice , their lives so that we may live in freedom today .",pos
2,cv229,13611,9,for this i thank them and for steve spielberg for making a movie that i will never forget .,pos
2,cv229,13611,10,"the academy will not forget tom hanks come april 1999 , as another well deserved oscar with be in tom's posession .",pos
2,cv230,7428,0,"well , i'll admit when i first heard about this film ( which was before dante's peak ) i could just smell what 'twister' had started .",pos
2,cv230,7428,1,so now it seems that we're in a full fledged return to the '70's disaster film era .,pos
2,cv230,7428,2,"with 'twister' , 'dante's peak' , 'volcano' and soon 'flood' and james cameron's extremly expensive 'titanic'",pos
2,cv230,7428,3,i'll say first off i enjoyed 'volcano' much more than i did 'dantes peak' .,pos
2,cv230,7428,4,part of that is just being biased as i usually enjoy anything that tommy lee jones appears in .,pos
2,cv230,7428,5,i've been reading a lot about the movie being 'cheezy' or 'hokey' and really didn't see or think that once during the entire film .,pos
2,cv230,7428,6,i get bored easily and this film didn't bore me for a minute .,pos
2,cv230,7428,7,"another thing , and boy am i bitching today ! , that bothers me is when critics and such go on about "" well thats not really possible . """,pos
2,cv230,7428,8,you know what ?,pos
2,cv230,7428,9,"i couldn't give a bloody damn if it's possible or not , really i couldn't .",pos

2,cv231,10425,4,"it's been the long intermission between projects as well as the dizzying peak which pulp fiction reached which has made mr . tarantino's new feature film , jackie brown , one of the most anticipated films of the year , and his third feature film cements his reputation as the single most important new american filmmaker to emerge from the 1990s .",pos

2,cv248,13987,5,"the difference in this case is that while my colleague ( an otherwise assuredly realistic individual ) truly believes in this in and of itself as a valid forecaster , pi uses this ideology as a device with which to investigate its character's psychosis .",pos

2,cv266,25779,2,the advent of the dvd format has provided a more accessible way to get these original cuts to the public and provide to film freaks like myself the ability to become further enraptured by the extension of such classic films .,pos
2,cv266,25779,3,"the dvd release of the original international version of luc besson's 1995 masterpiece the professional , which is known as l ? on around the world , is a prime example of how a good film can become an instant classic as a director's cut .",pos

2,cv266,25779,20,"the most ironic thing about the international version of the film is that with the inclusion of the missing scenes , the film becomes primarily a heavy , emotional drama punctuated with big action scenes at the beginning and the end of the film .",pos

2,cv268,18834,6,for plenty of reasons .,pos
2,cv268,18834,7,the story goes like this .,pos
2,cv268,18834,8,"a mobster ( robert deniro ) finds himself receiving several panic attacks as of late , fueled by the stress of an upcoming mobster meeting and a near-death following a drive-by shooting .",pos
2,cv268,18834,9,it's these attacks that prompt him to hire a psychiatrist ( billy crystal ) who's mostly reluctant to take the mobster's case for two reasons .,pos

2,cv268,18834,12,"fortunately , the movie is played out for plenty of laughs .",pos
2,cv268,18834,13,"director harold ramis ( who also helmed the comedy multiplicity , which wasn't half bad ) keeps the tone peppy and light , even if it's sometimes sprinkled by slight dramatic moments ( shootings can't always be taken for laughs , you know ) .",pos
2,cv268,18834,14,"deniro does some of his finest comic work since the king of comedy , giving off a somewhat similar performance to his role in goodfellas , but with a bit of a lighter heart .",pos
2,cv268,18834,15,( a scene where he tries to display his anger over the phone and fails miserably is hilarious . ),pos
2,cv268,18834,16,"crystal plays an excellent straight man to deniro's character , uplifting him from such bombs as father's day and my giant .",pos

2,cv268,18834,19,"not really , thanks to a simplistic ending and some slightly wasted moments with a character portrayed by chazz palminteri ( he's a comic actor , too , come on , give him some more ! ) , but it is an enjoyable romp that lets deniro do something different but same for a change , taking his dramatic act to a new field of comedy .",pos
2,cv268,18834,20,"kudos to crystal and kudrow for not just making it his show , either .",pos

2,cv269,21732,1,"others that are between a married couple that is impacting their relationship , like the problems of infertility affecting this upwardly mobile couple , geoffrey gaines ( stephen ramsey ) , the medical researcher working for a big corporation called fex and striving to get a patent for his experiment and become recognized in his field , and his artist wife , lillian ( miriam healy-louie ) , who reluctantly stands behind her husband suppressing her natural artistic tendencies in order to make the marriage work .",pos
2,cv269,21732,2,"and , still other secrets that have a greater implication for the world and are deadly in a political sense , of science carried out by the big corporations like it was a business run for the bottom line .",pos
2,cv269,21732,3,"receiving a summer grant to study "" chemo-electric therapy , "" geoffrey and his wife are hoping that a summer spent away from the intensity of the big city will bring back the romance that is dwindling from their marriage and that the casualness of the country atmosphere will give them more time together , as their three-year marriage has become shaky because he is more interested in his work than he is in her .",pos
2,cv269,21732,4,"he has slyly managed to keep his work as secretive as possible by locking himself in the lab , which is off limits to her , as he secretly goes about conducting experiments on rats and mice , convincing her that what he is doing is to benefit humanity with possible new treatments and cures to illnesses .",pos
2,cv269,21732,5,"his main argument is , that this is what the public wants , they don't want to hear about how some animals had to die because of these experiments , they just want the benefits of science .",pos
2,cv269,21732,6,"that he is depicted as a monster creating another monster , much like frankenstein was created , is the argument skewed by the director against his bad science ( science as a business ) as opposed to the good science ( science that cares about the small farmer ) , which is represented by the handsome and almost perfect gentleman , alex vine ( david ) , a young ecologist who chooses to work in the field , trying to get the farmers to go back to organic farming .",pos
2,cv269,21732,7,"he is hired by the university to monitor the dangers of pesticides and all the chemicals the farmer is almost forced to use to survive financially , as it is doing irreparable harm to him and the consumer because of all the health risks attached to this new way of farming , methods that have just come about in the last thirty- years and are being pushed by the big companies to enhance their profit margins .",pos
2,cv269,21732,8,"the third view in all this is the artist's , represented by lillian , who points out that the artist's work is shown in public and scrutinized constantly , "" why shouldn't the same be true of the scientist ? """,pos
2,cv269,21732,9,"she argues that the artist is the watchdog for the public , questioning what is good or evil in society , something that bad science has completely ignored .",pos

2,cv269,21732,12,"in the dinner scene that was , unfortunately , flatly done , but was nevertheless the heart of the film , as all the main characters get a chance to speak out from the point of view they represent as they eat meat , a means of getting protein that the radical scientists have eschewed since they became so politically correct about everything .",pos
2,cv269,21732,13,"the scientists engage in a rational argument , highlighting their different points of view , while lillian reacts in an emotional way , siding mostly with david's view but coming at it from a much different angle .",pos
2,cv269,21732,14,it was as if the actors were puppets on strings that the director controlled and they just spewed out their generalized philosophies .,pos
2,cv269,21732,15,"that the director's point of view is absolutely right , is beside the point .",pos
2,cv269,21732,16,the point is that the characters lost their humanity and became one-dimensional characters .,pos
2,cv269,21732,17,"geoffrey was likened to a hideous monster , alex vine was likened to his last name , the one who holds fast to the ground ensuring that the plant has stability , while lillian was likened to the muse of poetry and art , the inspiration for goodness and beauty .",pos
2,cv269,21732,18,"alex has been spending a lot of time together with lillian , as these two seem to share the same views and are physically attracted to each other , but when the time is ripe for an affair to take place between them , lillian changes her mind and decides not to go up to alex's apartment .",pos
2,cv269,21732,19,"geoffrey is already suspicious of alex and considers him an enemy , and the marriage seems to be coming apart and all his cunning tricks to possess her are no longer working , as it is now impossible to see any good in him and there becomes no reason why she would remain with him .",pos

2,cv269,21732,27,"the answers to these questions can best be answered by either good science or art , which are both closely related to the american natives vision of a world entrusted to mankind so that he can respect it and take care of it and enrich it with his creations to benefit mankind in a peaceful way .",pos
2,cv269,21732,28,"that this work fails to be subtle and polarizes opinions , leaving no room for deeper arguments , is the shame of this decent and smart film , that tried so hard to say what it felt it had to say but said it so loudly without trusting its audience to catch on to its message by not making everything seem so black and white .",pos
2,cv269,21732,29,no telling said a lot about the harmful trends it sees science going in ; it probably said too much and would have been better off if its vision was more poetical and less didactic .,pos
2,cv269,21732,30,"there is something about listening to a lecture that turns off the rebel in me , as i don't like being hit in the head with the truth but prefer to have it presented in the form that leads to inspiration or told metaphorically .",pos
2,cv269,21732,31,"that is not to say that i found the film without considerable merit , that inspite of its shortcomings , it was worth seeing because of its visual statements , though they were also not too subtle , they were at least effective in setting up the intense mood that the film needed to show that there is a mental war going on currently , of those who believe one way is right and others who differ with them , and that anyone who is neutral must be considered an enemy because of their indifference .",pos
2,cv269,21732,32,the stakes in this ecological struggle are that high .,pos
2,cv269,21732,33,"perhaps the most powerful visual statement in the film , was the dead cow from pesticides shown in the opening scene .",pos
2,cv269,21732,34,it was the image that lillian spent her time painting all summer and had the same affect for her as did the animal faces in picasso's guernica had for him .,pos
2,cv269,21732,35,"both artists envisioned the horrors that man could do against the world , and represented this unspoken pain on the faces of the animals so that anyone who cares to really see what is going on , will not mistake which side of the fence he or she should be on .",pos
2,cv269,21732,36,"the pain that lillian feels , as she forgets about her desires to raise a family , and she stares at her painting of the cow and the song , "" make the world go away "" blares out from the background , after she has learned that frances' beautiful and loving dog has been brutalized by her monster of a husband , all in the name of science , had a raw power to it that personalizes the dangers of bad science .",pos
2,cv269,21732,37,"perhaps , the most pertinent question the film asks , requires an answer that must be resolved by the farmers and the consumers who are most caught in the changing world and its new way of doing business , as the question becomes , can science be happily married with art ?",pos

2,cv278,13041,5,it was far more pulp than pulitzer .,pos

2,cv278,13041,13,but the parallel does suggest that it is possible to create great cinema from questionable source material .,pos

2,cv278,13041,15,depends on whom you ask .,pos
2,cv278,13041,16,but there's no question that grisham's work grabs people .,pos
2,cv278,13041,17,"like puzo , grisham is a better storyteller than a writer - unlike fellow hack michael crichton , who is a good idea man but who can't tell a well-constructed story from a can of spam .",pos
2,cv278,13041,18,"so something in grisham's unpublished story of a cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved in a deadly family squabble drew the attention of robert altman , who at 73 years old remains one of america's greatest living filmmakers .",pos

2,cv278,13041,49,dialog overlaps and the actors seem to slip naturally into an improvisational style .,pos

2,cv278,13041,53,the naked actress shot has become as ubiquitous to the altman film as the director cameo was to the hitchcock film .,pos

2,cv278,13041,58,"in the hands of a master like altman , it becomes an exercise in existential doom , in its own way far more successful than scorsese's cape fear remake , which tried for the same result .",pos
2,cv278,13041,59,"what may prevent it from enduring with altman's greatest work is a weak third act - in fact , there really is no third act in grisham's story , so it appears that altman had to throw in the hurricane just to jazz things up .",pos
2,cv278,13041,60,"but there are true moments of riveting suspense , and great performances by branagh , davidzt and downey jr - more than enough to see you through .",pos
2,cv278,13041,61,"that polygram so hated this picture that they tried to steal final cut from altman , and then buried the marketing campaign when he won it back , should tell you how utterly clueless of quality most studios are .",pos

2,cv284,19119,41,"not necessarily by leaps and bounds , but since they put out a new film each year , a steady rate of improvement is apparent , and this definitely shows in tarzan .",pos

2,cv286,25050,2,"on the other hand , it seems that something more than atlantic ocean divides europe from america , because one of the most popular and beloved european films takes exactly the opposite view .",pos
2,cv286,25050,3,"this film is amarcord , 1974 comedy by famous italian director federico fellini , which later gave inspiration to numerous imitations and homages , and even led few american screen artists to adopt its heretical views about benefits of small town life .",pos
2,cv286,25050,4,the film is based on the screenplay by fellini and tonino guerra and it lacks the plot in usual sense .,pos
2,cv286,25050,5,"instead we follow one year in 1930s italian summer resort town of rimini through the series of short vignettes that depict various local events and customs , as well as series of local , often very colourful characters .",pos
2,cv286,25050,6,"although many of those characters occasionally take the role of narrator , movie concentrates on its nominal protagonist , 14-year old boy titta ( played by bruno zanin ) and chronicles his sexual frustrations , obsession with local beauty queen named gradisca ( played by magali noel ) , problems in his lovingly dysfunctional family , as well as troubles his father ( played by armando brancia ) have with mussolini's fascist regime .",pos
2,cv286,25050,7,"amarcord was often noted as the ultimate nostalgia film , and it probably explains why it is very popular , even among those people who actually don't like federico fellini's work very much .",pos
2,cv286,25050,8,"every member of its potential audience would find part of himself or herself in this film , because fellini in this film clearly illustrates natural human desire to paint past in the best way possible .",pos
2,cv286,25050,9,"distortion between actual past and its subjective interpretation could be found even in the title of the film - word "" amarcord "" is nothing more than badly pronounced phrase "" i remember "" in local italian dialect .",pos
2,cv286,25050,10,"in the same way the word is distorted , so is the past in memories of those who remember it .",pos
2,cv286,25050,11,"after the premiere , fellini rejected any claims about autobiographical character of this film , but it doesn't matter whether rimini of amarcord actually resembles rimini of fellini's childhood or not ; any place and any time could resemble characters and situations of this film .",pos
2,cv286,25050,12,fellini's views on nostalgia are clearly illustrated with a way he mixes reality and fantasy in this film .,pos
2,cv286,25050,13,even the most naturalistic scenes are laced with dark humour and grotesque images .,pos
2,cv286,25050,14,"characters look like caricatures , actors playing them often deliberately overact , and women , especially those who fuel titta's sexual fantasies , often have certain body parts with gargantuan proportions .",pos
2,cv286,25050,15,"every now and then , scenes that depict 1930s reality gradually slide into fantasies of movie's characters and rimini becomes almost indistinguishable from the magical place in characters' visions .",pos
2,cv286,25050,16,"because of that , almost everything in this film looks different , and in most cases better , than it would have looked in the real life .",pos
2,cv286,25050,17,even the fascism gets fellinian make-over - fellini views mussolini's totalitarian regime as nothing more than visual spectacle ( explaining why similar regimes enjoyed such popular support throughout history ) and opportunity for comedy .,pos
2,cv286,25050,18,"when fascists finally show their true colours and begin torturing their opponents , even this becomes opportunity for scenes of macabre humour .",pos
2,cv286,25050,19,"unlike many of his italian colleagues in 1970s , who had used 1930s period setting to explicitly condemn fascism and serve fashionable political agenda , fellini doesn't care that much about politics .",pos
2,cv286,25050,20,lack of self-righteous moral perspective is compensated with fellini's humanistic approach to his characters .,pos
2,cv286,25050,21,"each of them , regardless of age , gender , social class or physical appearance , is given opportunity to express his or her views , dreams and fears .",pos
2,cv286,25050,22,"fellini treats all those characters with warmth and affection , even when he paints them as grotesque caricatures of real people .",pos
2,cv286,25050,23,"because of this warmth and democratic spirit , amarcord could be viewed as one of the most humane films of 20th century , and it keeps its general feel good atmosphere despite depicting having many uncomfortable , melancholic and even tragic moments .",pos
2,cv286,25050,24,fellini couldn't produce such effects without using his own directorial talent that gave a very personal touch to this movie .,pos
2,cv286,25050,25,"vignettes aren't memorable because of the characters only ; fellini uses camera , painting film in bright colours , especially in the scenes that depict character's fantasies .",pos
2,cv286,25050,26,"fellini also knows how to use locations , whether such location happens to be luxurious hotel , bright-coloured beach or rural countryside .",pos
2,cv286,25050,27,"even the down-to-earth streets of rimini , where everyone knows everyone , gets magical dimension during the snowfall .",pos
2,cv286,25050,28,"on the other hand , lack of credible special effects somewhat diminished the same effect during the ocean liner scene .",pos
2,cv286,25050,29,this atmosphere is also provided by incredible talent of composer and fellini's long-time associate nino rota .,pos
2,cv286,25050,30,"his amarcord theme is probably one of the most recognisable , most popular and most relaxing and uplifting pieces of film music ever produced .",pos

3,cv305,9946,0,"of all the films i've come to see this year ( 1997 ) , i think only chasing amy had as many "" laugh-out-loud "" moments .",pos
3,cv305,9946,1,"i'm not saying that i was hysterically rolling on the floor while watching waiting for guffman , but my mouth burst open with at least a delighted guffaw at least every couple of minutes .",pos

3,cv305,9946,3,"usually all you can get out of me is a warm smile , so to get me laughing out loud , and so frequently , is a really good sign .",pos
3,cv305,9946,4,"waiting for guffman is the story of blaine , missouri , a town celebrating it's 150th anniversary , and the musical that is being put on for the big event .",pos
3,cv305,9946,5,"the play is being directed by corky st . clair ( christopher guest , who also wrote and directed this "" mockumentary "" as well as co-writing several original musical numbers ) , the effeminate broadway hopeful determined to make this production a smashing success .",pos
3,cv305,9946,6,"teaming up with st . clair are a handful of blaine residents : allan pearl ( eugene levy ) , a jewish dentist who spent his youth not as the class clown , but sitting right next to him and studying him , ron and sheila albertson ( fred willard and catherine o'hara respectively ) , a married couple setting their sights on hollywood , libby mae brown ( parker posey ) , the dense but fun queen of the dairy queen , and a few others .",pos
3,cv305,9946,7,"everybody in this movie is brilliant , absolutely so , but levy particularly stands out .",pos
3,cv305,9946,8,"these characters are portrayed with such saddening realism that you can't help but love them , as pathetic as they really are .",pos
3,cv305,9946,9,"although levy stands out , guest , willard , o'hara , and posey are all wonderful and definitely should be commended for their performances !",pos
3,cv305,9946,10,"if there was an oscar for an ensemble performance , this is the group that should sweep it .",pos
3,cv305,9946,11,"some humor was a tad uneven from the rest of the film and , even after starting very humorously , they nearly lost me with the tad-too-long intros .",pos
3,cv305,9946,12,"as delightful as it was , it began to get monotonous .",pos
3,cv305,9946,13,"thankfully , just as your about to say "" ok , maybe i should run to the bathroom "" , they finally get past the intros and onto the rehearsal scenes .",pos
3,cv305,9946,14,"like a play , this film gives a very three-act feel , the intros ( funny , but almost too long ) , the rehearsals ( even funnier ) , and finally , the actual performance of the play ( excellent ! ) .",pos
3,cv305,9946,15,"like i said , each character really shines , even when done with a subtle approach .",pos
3,cv305,9946,16,you can't really watch these people and not think they're real people !,pos
3,cv305,9946,17,"even they way they talk , with awkward pauses and stumbles that don't feel staged at all , you feel like you're watching a real , albeit funny , documentary .",pos
3,cv305,9946,18,"and even with silly lyrics , the original songs when the play is finally put on , are absolutely wonderful !",pos
3,cv305,9946,19,"as a word of note , despite it's "" r "" rating , waiting for guffman is really quite clean .",pos
3,cv305,9946,20,"this rating came from a brief , very brief use of the grand-daddy of all swear words .",pos
3,cv305,9946,21,"even if that really bothers you , let me say that it's not presented in a vulgar , cheap-laugh way .",pos
3,cv305,9946,22,it's actually quite humorous and tastefully done !,pos
3,cv305,9946,23,it might be hard knowing what to expect with waiting for guffman .,pos
3,cv305,9946,24,"it's silly humor , but it's also so dry , subtle , and intelligently done that you're not insulted by it .",pos
3,cv305,9946,25,"it's always really nice to see a comedy that isn't all slapstick and vulgarity , and this film is one of the better ones of the better ones !",pos
3,cv305,9946,26,i'd recommend seeing it !,pos
3,cv306,10364,0,"in essence , good will hunting is an ordinary story told well .",pos
3,cv306,10364,1,"taken as a whole , there's little that's special about this tale -- it follows a traditional narrative path , leaves the audience with a warm , fuzzy feeling , and never really challenges or surprises us .",pos
3,cv306,10364,2,"but it's intelligently written ( with dialogue that is occasionally brilliant ) , strongly directed , and nicely acted .",pos
3,cv306,10364,3,"so , while good will hunting is far from a late-year masterpiece , it's a worthwhile sample of entertainment .",pos
3,cv306,10364,4,"like scent of a woman , which was released around this time of the season five years ago , good will hunting is about the unlikely friendship that develops between a world-weary veteran and a cocky young man .",pos
3,cv306,10364,5,the formula for the two films is similar -- both of the principals learn from each other as they slowly break down their barriers on the way to a better understanding of life and their place in it -- but the characters are different .,pos
3,cv306,10364,6,al pacino's slade was a larger-than-life individual ; robin williams' sean mcguire is much more subtle .,pos
3,cv306,10364,7,and matt damon's will hunting uses pugnaciousness to supplant the blandness of chris o'donnell's charlie .,pos
3,cv306,10364,8,will is a troubled individual .,pos
3,cv306,10364,9,"as a child , he was the frequent victim of abuse .",pos

3,cv306,10364,15,"then , one evening , his anonymity is shattered when professor lambeau ( stellan skarsgard ) catches him at work .",pos

3,cv306,10364,18,the judge agrees to release will under two conditions : that he spend one day a week meeting with lambeau and that he spend one day a week meeting with a therapist .,pos
3,cv306,10364,19,"eventually , once several psychologists have rejected the belligerent young man , sean mcguire , a teacher at bunker hill community college , agrees to take the case .",pos

3,cv306,10364,22,"the script , by co-stars matt damon and ben affleck , is not a groundbreaking piece of literature , and occasionally resorts to shameless manipulation .",pos
3,cv306,10364,23,"the characters are well-developed , however , and there are times when the dialogue positively sparkles .",pos
3,cv306,10364,24,"at one point , will comments that a session with sean is turning into a "" taster's choice moment . """,pos
3,cv306,10364,25,"later , will gives a brilliant , breathless diatribe against the nsa that has the rhythm of something written by kevin smith .",pos
3,cv306,10364,26,"( note : since smith co-executive produced good will hunting , it's not out of the question that he had some input into this scene . )",pos
3,cv306,10364,27,"director gus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , to die for ) culls genuine emotion from his actors , and this results in several affecting and powerful scenes .",pos
3,cv306,10364,28,"there's an edginess to some of the sean/will therapy sessions , and the offscreen chemistry between matt damon and minnie driver ( who became romantically linked while making this film ) translates effectively to the movie -- the will/skylar relationship is electric .",pos
3,cv306,10364,29,"likewise , the companionability of damon and affleck is apparent in the easygoing nature of will and chuckie's friendship .",pos
3,cv306,10364,30,"many of the individual scenes are strong enough to earn good will hunting a recommendation , even if the overall story is somewhat generic .",pos
3,cv306,10364,31,"matt damon , who recently starred as the idealistic young lawyer in the rainmaker , is solid ( although not spectacular ) as will .",pos
3,cv306,10364,32,minnie driver ( last seen in grosse pointe blank ) adds another strong performance to a growing resume ( and it's refreshing that she was allowed to keep her british accent rather than having to attempt an american one ) .,pos
3,cv306,10364,33,"the outstanding performance of the film belongs to robin williams , whose sean is sad and wise , funny and somber .",pos
3,cv306,10364,34,"arguably the best dramatic work in the actor's career ( alongside what he did in the fisher king ) , williams' portrayal could earn him a best supporting actor oscar nomination .",pos
3,cv306,10364,35,adequate support is provided by ben affleck ( chasing amy ) and stellan skarsgard ( breaking the waves ) .,pos
3,cv306,10364,36,"like most of what comes before it , the ending of good will hunting is completely predictable .",pos
3,cv306,10364,37,"but meeting expectations and following a familiar path aren't always bad things in a movie , provided the film accomplishes those goals with a modicum of style and an attention to detail .",pos
3,cv306,10364,38,"good will hunting does both , and , as a result , earns a rating commensurate with the "" good "" in the title .",pos
3,cv307,25270,0,"clue is an unfairly ignored comedy , very similar to 1976's murder by death .",pos
3,cv307,25270,1,this big screen version of the classic board game ( what's next . . .,pos
3,cv307,25270,2,chutes and ladders : the motion picture ? ) is filled with slapstick antics and silly dialogue .,pos
3,cv307,25270,3,"the plot , for what it's worth , has all the characters from the game ( in this case , the names from the game are used as aliases ) meeting in an isolated mansion to confront mr . boddy ( lee ving ) , the man who's been blackmailing them all .",pos

3,cv307,25270,8,"to this day , whenever someone says the phrase "" well , to make a long story short "" i have the follow up phrase "" too late "" ready to go .",pos
3,cv307,25270,9,"the cast ( all very good comedic talents ) play well off one another , while the late madeline kahn ( as the dark and sultry mrs . white ) sometimes steals the film away from the rest .",pos

3,cv307,25270,11,clue is available on dvd from paramount home video .,pos
3,cv307,25270,12,it includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 ( and is enhanced for 16x9 televisions ) and features the original theatrical trailer .,pos

3,cv307,25270,15,"also , the trailer is scored to the music from airplane ! , which was an interesting choice .",pos
3,cv307,25270,16,"when clue played in theaters , it ran with the gimmick of three different endings .",pos
3,cv307,25270,17,"if you wanted to see all three , you had to go to the movies three separate times .",pos

3,cv307,25270,26,"now while i applaud the effort of paramount here , as they clearly tried to do something special with the disc , it just doesn't work well .",pos
3,cv307,25270,27,"first , why not give the viewer the choice of what ending we want to watch ?",pos
3,cv307,25270,28,maybe someone like myself who's seen the movie hundreds of times would like to sit down and show it to someone with the second ending only .,pos
3,cv307,25270,29,"i'm no technical dvd expert , but i can't imagine that being too hard to accomplish .",pos
3,cv307,25270,30,"secondly , the delay between when the film itself ends and one of the endings begins is too long and too obvious , thereby becoming a distraction right when you definitely don't need a distraction .",pos
3,cv307,25270,31,"finally , the back of the dvd case states "" and now , with this special dvd version , you can see all 3 surprise endings "" .",pos
3,cv307,25270,32,"i have no idea why they would word it that way , since that's not a special feature in the slightest .",pos
3,cv307,25270,33,"the video has been out for fifteen years now ( good lord , has it been that long ? ) and it's played on television with all three endings all the time .",pos
3,cv307,25270,34,"these are merely minor complaints however , seeing that i've watched the home video version hundreds of times and have no problem watching the film as such on the dvd .",pos
3,cv307,25270,35,"the picture and sound are wonderfully improved over my worn out vhs copy , and i'm thrilled that paramount agrees with me that clue is a film worthy of being preserved on this great digital format .",pos

3,cv308,5016,7,"during a pit stop , they get separated from weitzman and are left to fend for themselves in manhattan .",pos
3,cv308,5016,8,the movie's charm derives mostly from the camaraderie and chemistry between its delightful cast .,pos

3,cv308,5016,11,the actors in the dream team have a lot of fun with their characters and with each other .,pos
3,cv308,5016,12,michael keaton is well cast as billy ; he gives his cynical character considerable complexity .,pos
3,cv308,5016,13,"as the divinely jack , peter boyle succeeds in keeping his one-dimensional character funny and fresh .",pos
3,cv308,5016,14,"although stephen furst's catatonic character is cliched , the actor makes him sympathetic and endearing .",pos
3,cv308,5016,15,"while keaton , boyle , and furst are good , it's christopher lloyd who really makes the movie special .",pos
3,cv308,5016,16,lloyd gives yet another outstanding comic performance .,pos
3,cv308,5016,17,"his body language ( for example , the way he walks ) and his facial expressions are perfectly suited to his compulsive character .",pos
3,cv308,5016,18,"lloyd's brilliant performance yields a pathetic , moving , and memorable character .",pos
3,cv308,5016,19,the dream team is a solid comedy with more depth and drama than you might expect from its simple premise .,pos
3,cv308,5016,20,the characters are so appealing that you can excuse the film for its often outlandish and unbelievable plot .,pos
3,cv309,22571,0,"people who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels , stories , comic books or movies .",pos
3,cv309,22571,1,"often science fiction aficionados find material , previously labelled as science fiction , to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror , or rather simple techno-thriller .",pos
3,cv309,22571,2,"in such cases , mistakes are understandable - genre boundaries are never clearly marked .",pos
3,cv309,22571,3,"but , i believe there are really few cases when a movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic .",pos
3,cv309,22571,4,"such thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago , when national distributors gave such treatment to the right stuff , 1983 film directed by philip kaufman .",pos
3,cv309,22571,5,the mistake of the distributors could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits .,pos
3,cv309,22571,6,but the right stuff film isn't even fiction .,pos
3,cv309,22571,7,"it was based on the non-fiction book by tom wolfe , covering the early years of american space program .",pos
3,cv309,22571,8,"the plot of the film begins in 1947 when few people heard of edwards air force base , major test site for experimental planes .",pos
3,cv309,22571,9,the major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach 1 mach speed and thus break the sound barrier .,pos
3,cv309,22571,10,many pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado .,pos
3,cv309,22571,11,"but one quiet pilot , chuck eager ( played by sam shaped ) succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots , determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records .",pos

3,cv309,22571,14,"best air force , navy and marine pilots are recruited into program , but not yeager , because he lacks college education and desired all-american image .",pos
3,cv309,22571,15,in one of critics' polls the right stuff was named as one among top 10 films made in 1980s .,pos
3,cv309,22571,16,such high position could be explained with the fact that kaufman's film looks quite atypical for its time .,pos
3,cv309,22571,17,with more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for 1950s and 1960s - age when hollywood used to make films larger than life .,pos
3,cv309,22571,18,but the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker .,pos
3,cv309,22571,19,"philip kaufman created reputation in 1970s by using all the opportunities of that golden age in order to create original , memorable movies .",pos
3,cv309,22571,20,"the right stuff was the last of them , swan song of an era when producers allowed directors to spend big bucks on unusual , risk-taking "" artsy "" projects .",pos
3,cv309,22571,21,the right stuff is unusual because it lacks many standard elements of hollywood film .,pos
3,cv309,22571,22,"the plot is almost non-existent and not very coherent ; the story , featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes , shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots , embodied in yeager , to new generation of the astronauts .",pos
3,cv309,22571,23,"the film also lacks conventional protagonist - yeager ( who also appears in small cameo ) remains the true hero of the film , but equal time and exposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives , making this movie into ensemble piece .",pos
3,cv309,22571,24,"that gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents , until that specialised only for bit or character roles .",pos
3,cv309,22571,25,"sam shepard is great as yeager , war hero whose greatest achievement - breech of the sound barrier - remained obscured in history books , probably due to his own modesty .",pos
3,cv309,22571,26,"on the surface , he lacks personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues , but shepard gives texture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases .",pos
3,cv309,22571,27,shepard's performance is followed with great acting by ed harris as clean-cut marine ( and future politician ) john glenn .,pos
3,cv309,22571,28,"young dennis quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper , and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of virgil grissom , superbly played by fred ward .",pos
3,cv309,22571,29,always reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator and ( arguably ) first american man in space alan shepard .,pos
3,cv309,22571,30,"kaufman left room for female talents to excel too - barbara hershey , pamela reed , veronica cartwright and mary jo deschanel are great as pilots' wives .",pos
3,cv309,22571,31,"royal dano is also impressive as menacing figure of preacher , but the most memorable performances belong to donald moffat as vice-president lyndon b . johnson and jane dornacker as nurse murch .",pos
3,cv309,22571,32,great acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with kaufman's superb direction .,pos
3,cv309,22571,33,most notable of all is the methods kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of time .,pos
3,cv309,22571,34,"the beginning of the film shows test pilots living in the middle of desert , as virtual unknowns , far away from strict rules and discipline .",pos
3,cv309,22571,35,everything seems natural -yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world .,pos
3,cv309,22571,36,"in that setting , it's quite normal for important technical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw and for the test pilots not to report their ribs being broken before most important flights .",pos
3,cv309,22571,37,"but the times are changing ; ww2 alliance with ussr is replaced with cold war , and "" natural "" pilots like yeager must be replaced with more disciplined , conventional pilots .",pos
3,cv309,22571,38,"their entire lives become focus of media frenzy , and their job is subjected to strict rules , meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats , publicity-seeking politicians and uncaring scientists ( like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun , played by scott beach ) only to preserve their most basic human dignity .",pos
3,cv309,22571,39,"this contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence - while yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test flight in absolute obscurity , "" mercury "" astronauts receive fame and fortune , although some of them even before going in the space .",pos
3,cv309,22571,40,those contrasts and similar effects are achieved with kaufman's superb use of poetic movie language .,pos
3,cv309,22571,41,"editing is great , and photography by caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like the funeral in the desert or astronauts in their suits walking in slow motion ( the same image would be copied in many latter films ) .",pos
3,cv309,22571,42,"although kaufman enjoyed support of nasa and american military , which provided authentic locations and period equipment , he still had to use special effects in order to simulate space flights .",pos

3,cv309,22571,48,"some of the "" mercury "" astronauts aren't fleshed out enough ( although being played by fine actors , like lance henriksen ) .",pos
3,cv309,22571,49,film also lacks proper closure .,pos
3,cv309,22571,50,"on the other hand , most logical conclusion of the film - landing on the moon - would require this film to be more than six hours long .",pos
3,cv309,22571,51,"also , some critics were prone to attack this film as too amerocentric and hard on russians , who were portrayed as evil monsters , just in line with most virulent cold war rhetoric of reagan's america .",pos
3,cv309,22571,52,"in some of contemporary interviews , kaufman defended that approach by claiming that he wanted to make film as authentic as possible , and in order to do that , he portrayed russians not as they were in real life , but as they were perceived by americans in early 1960s .",pos

3,cv310,13091,5,the x-files is the film that continues the story where the season finale left off .,pos
3,cv310,13091,6,"the film is like a two-hour episode , except that there are a lot more special effects , the plot is thicker , and the resolution is more satisfying .",pos
3,cv310,13091,7,"this is a terrific film , both for fans of the series and for those who have never seen it ( i imagine that viewers unfamiliar with the show will find the film to be solid and riveting entertainment ) .",pos
3,cv310,13091,8,"i expected to like it more than any episode i've seen , and my expectations were met .",pos
3,cv310,13091,9,"actually , the film takes a few risks in its story and plot devices , but , thankfully , the makers managed to do it right .",pos
3,cv310,13091,10,"when the finale ended , the fbi branch known as the x-files had been destroyed , and our heroes , mulder ( david duchovny ) and scully ( gillian anderson ) were left stripped of five years of hard work .",pos
3,cv310,13091,11,the film picks up soon after ; and mulder and scully have been reduced to field agents investigating a bomb threat in a federal building .,pos
3,cv310,13091,12,"but wait , i'm getting ahead of myself .",pos
3,cv310,13091,13,"the film actually opens in the ice age , about 32 , 000 years prior , during which a couple of prehistoric guys get attacked by a vicious alien .",pos
3,cv310,13091,14,"the alien's blood infects them ( fans of the show will certainly remember the black cancer ) , and the story jumps into modern times , during which a young boy is also infected with the cancer .",pos
3,cv310,13091,15,"it turns out that the bomb was planted to kill the boy , and mulder and scully uncover the cover-up despite the fact that scully has resigned from her position in the fbi .",pos
3,cv310,13091,16,"soon , they find out that the whole thing has to do with aliens .",pos
3,cv310,13091,17,"as i've written before , it's not easy to write plot summaries for films like this , because everything needs to be a surprise .",pos
3,cv310,13091,18,"fans of the show will know what to expect , and i seriously doubt any of them being disappointed with the film .",pos
3,cv310,13091,19,"director rob bowman has done a great job expanding the eerie feeling of the show to the big screen , making small adjustments and minor changes to utilize the possibilities that film allows over television .",pos
3,cv310,13091,20,"there are some truly suspenseful and well-created scenes here ( late in the film , when they're in the alien spacecraft , you'll see one of the better action sequences in recent cinema ) .",pos
3,cv310,13091,21,"the special effects are very good , and the production design by christopher nowak is fantastic .",pos
3,cv310,13091,22,what i find interesting is that the x-files is actually a great way for series neophytes to get into the story .,pos
3,cv310,13091,23,"our heroes are given subtle introductions ( we're not expected to know them on the outset ) , and the film explains enough of the story that prior knowledge of the series isn't required to understand the film .",pos
3,cv310,13091,24,"there are , of course , little elements that the makers have included as payoff to the fans , but i'll keep those as surprises .",pos
3,cv310,13091,25,"it takes a lot of thought and understanding of the series to create a film using roots as complicated as the ones that the series provides , and then create a coherent film that anyone can understand clearly .",pos
3,cv310,13091,26,the series is strong for a lot of reasons .,pos
3,cv310,13091,27,"it's original ( though it has many ties to "" the twilight zone "" and owes some homage to hitchcock ) , and impressively eerie for a television show .",pos
3,cv310,13091,28,"what really makes the series shine , however , are the actors .",pos

3,cv310,13091,32,"both performers have acted in little more than their series , however , though i think they'll both get their chances to prove themselves very soon .",pos
3,cv310,13091,33,"i enthusiastically recommend the x-files , both for fans and non-fans .",pos
3,cv310,13091,34,"1998 is a summer filled with disappointing blockbusters , and this film should satisfy where most of the others leave you completely dry .",pos
3,cv310,13091,35,"it's an intelligent film , and takes you places that you might not have been ( or , at least , might not have seen so many times that they feel familiar ) .",pos
3,cv310,13091,36,"the x-files is impressive in concept , as well : fans of the series are likely to be highly critical , and to take the premise beyond the series is a risky move .",pos

3,cv311,16002,9,"the story takes place at the extravagant home of an aging patriarch ( henning mortizen ) , who has just turned 60 and is having a party thrown for him .",pos

3,cv311,16002,14,"once they're all there and settled in , the party begins , and as custom , the eldest son has to make a speech to his dad , so christian stands up , at the head of the table , and reveals the film's punchline : his father raped all his children at a young age .",pos
3,cv311,16002,15,"but since this is a family/friends affair , his confession becomes more detested than the supposed truth , and is simply brushed off despite his efforts , and what transpires is sorta like jerry springer crossed with jean renoir , and it's all terribly interesting to watch .",pos
3,cv311,16002,16,"twists occur , and soon the film has taken on a nearly-farsical nature , but still seems realistic because the people involved really feel like they could reach such ends .",pos
3,cv311,16002,17,"the most notorious thing about this film , which has been getting the most notice , though , is that the director , thomas vinterberg has shot it in a completely awkward fashion .",pos
3,cv311,16002,18,"as a member of the danish filmmakers clan , dogme 95 , a group that has vowed to oppose "" the auteur concept , make-up , illusions , and dramaturgical predictability "" so that they may "" purge film so that once again the inner lives of the characters justify the plot . """,pos

3,cv311,16002,22,"we see key moments in people's lives that they wouldn't dare show to the world , and it captures the farscial comedy of life so accurately and acutely that this style , as ironically-showmanship as it really is , works perfectly for the nature of the film .",pos
3,cv311,16002,23,"the key , though , to this film , and the reason it's not just a cool danish import , is because this film is not about revealing the truth as much as it is about the way people react to such an explosive truth .",pos
3,cv311,16002,24,"throughout the film , we see a completely realized debate over the truth and the effects it has on the lives of those who have learned to live with lies , a debate so three-dimensional that it could easily blow oliver stone and his the-truth-at-all-costs reasoning out of the water .",pos
3,cv311,16002,25,"of course it was not right for the father to rape his children , and of course , they couldn't have fought back then , and of course this has created scarring suppression inside them .",pos

3,cv311,16002,27,"but then again , the father , after all , is not a totally bad guy , and we can see the emotional complications that arise thanks to a performance by mortizen which is just so great and touching that while we do believe that he could have raped his children years earlier , we also see a man who has also learned to live with what he's done , and deep down , feels true guilt that is only now beginning to surface .",pos
3,cv311,16002,28,"the final scene , involving mortizen and everyone else , is utterly devastating , thanks to him and thomsen , whose performance is utterly flawless and equally emotionally complex .",pos

3,cv315,11629,29,"secondly , cameron keeps the storyline focused almost exclusively on the rose character , and the romantic triangle between rose ( winslet ) , her bastard millionaire fiancee cal hockley ( billy zane ) and the irrepressible young artist jack daswon ( dicaprio ) .",pos
3,cv315,11629,30,"the way that big-budget disaster movies usually go wrong is to have an all-star cast , so we see the impact of the disaster on a wide group of people .",pos

3,cv317,24049,0,john cusack is the kind of actor who seems to effortlessly slide into his respective film roles .,pos
3,cv317,24049,1,"so effortlessly that people tend to forget he's there , much in the way people rarely recall many of the great character actors ( anyone who can put the name james rebhorn with that actor's face is invited to treat themselves to a product from one of my sponsors ) .",pos
3,cv317,24049,2,"example : the other day my mother asked me ( the expert , of course ) if there were any movies out worth seeing , never mind that our tastes couldn't be more divergent--- i'll never forget the day she recommended that i go see a night at the roxbury for god sakes , and to be fair she was mightily pissed at me for telling her that go !",pos
3,cv317,24049,3,"was a lot of fun ( which it is ) , so i didn't see this as anything more than a futile attempt at conversation .",pos
3,cv317,24049,4,"i muttered , with a little trepidation , that she might enjoy high fidelity .",pos
3,cv317,24049,5,"she responded with her usual query , "" whose in that one ? """,pos
3,cv317,24049,6,this is a question whose answer that seems to immediately conjure up the kind of movie you went to see .,pos
3,cv317,24049,7,"if the reply is julia roberts you probably assume it was something wispy and light , a sylvester stallone movie and you picture a bloodbath with few words and much involuntary bicep flexing , and a woody allen movie means hyper articulate white people ( usually of the jewish faith ) fretting about in some upper east side palace .",pos
3,cv317,24049,8,"anyway , when i answered "" john cusack "" , she replied with a rather stunned "" who ? "" , as if it was unreasonable for her to know whom i was referring to .",pos
3,cv317,24049,9,"now i know for a fact that my mother has seen several cusack movies , most recently being john malkovich and pushing tin , but i suppose it's understandable that she would not recognize the name , after all , for most , names are tougher than faces .",pos
3,cv317,24049,10,"i showed her a picture of cusack's mug in the paper hoping for an "" oh - him , yes he's quite good "" instead i got a "" no - i don't know him "" .",pos
3,cv317,24049,11,"at this point i was way beyond frustration into a realm of nose hair yanking anger ( yes , filmic ignorance is all it takes to get me into the nose hair pulling zone ) , till i realized something : i doubt that much of america would recognize cusack's relatively bland visage , or even the name which is rather bland compared to the coolness of a brad pitt or tom cruise , one-syllable names that glide off the tongue with the velocity of a speeding car .",pos
3,cv317,24049,12,"cu-sack . cu-sack - no , not quite as cool .",pos
3,cv317,24049,13,"i'm sure that twenty years from now cusack will forever be referred to as "" the guy from ( add in the cusack film of your choice ) "" .",pos
3,cv317,24049,14,"he's not a brand name , and his movies usually aren't big moneymakers , but in his own unassuming way he's kind of a genius .",pos
3,cv317,24049,15,"with his pleasant , common man looks , and charming semi-articulate blatherings he has become one of the most likeable romantic leading men of the 90's .",pos
3,cv317,24049,16,from the sure thing to say anything cusack has merged the talents of early tom hanks and early jack lemmon .,pos
3,cv317,24049,17,"despite the fact that nearly every character he plays is a variation of the character before it ( the schlumpy every man ) , he's a constantly enjoyable screen persona , like albert brooks or woody allen .",pos
3,cv317,24049,18,"and he knows how to chose scripts , while the stephan baldwin's and val kilmer's seem to put them selves in everything ( the former actually had the insight to follow up oscar winner usual suspects with a pauly shore vehicle , and judging from his latest projects it looks like he still has yet to fire his agent ) , cusack generally picks rewarding projects ( save for the unwatchable hot pursuit , a 1988 film also featuring a young ben stiller ) .",pos
3,cv317,24049,19,"high fidelity is his second collaboration with hit or miss english director stephan fears ( the grifters , the hi-lo country ) , and it's a hit .",pos
3,cv317,24049,20,"it was also co-written by cusack , and some of his collaborators on the terrific comedy , grosse point blank .",pos
3,cv317,24049,21,"it's not quite as entertaining or as funny as that film , but as it progresses in its meandering fashion , the movie cast something of a spell over me .",pos
3,cv317,24049,22,"high fidelity begins as a hipster ode to the non-committal rob , a vinyl record store owner , who opens the film by breaking down the fourth wall with much abandon and educating us in his "" top 5 break ups list "" .",pos
3,cv317,24049,23,this is something cusack does the entire film a la ferris bueller's day off .,pos
3,cv317,24049,24,"at first the talking-directly-into-the-camera-schtick had me vaguely annoyed , mostly because it reminded me so much of the film body shots which used a similar conceit , but it began to grow on me due almost entirely to cusack's witty delivery .",pos
3,cv317,24049,25,he's the kind of guy we don't mind talking directly to us .,pos
3,cv317,24049,26,"gradually the film settles into a shampoo-like tragi-comic character study , of a guy who must confront himself and his personal failures in order to figure out the true person he is ( yes it's all very existential ) .",pos
3,cv317,24049,27,"though that plot-line is mostly enjoyable , the thing i liked the most about the film is how much pleasure it offers in introducing us to minor characters , all of whom ( now this is really something ) are terrific enough to warrant their own films .",pos
3,cv317,24049,28,"the best of which is jack black ( of the very funny show tenacious d , a program that sadly went the way of bruce willis' hair ? ? ? unfortunately that annoying smirk remains ) , an ardent record store employee who bullies customers into buying exactly what he wants them to buy .",pos
3,cv317,24049,29,"he's the kind of guy i'm sure we've all met before , a blowhard who thinks he's always right and will do anything in his power ( be it yell , argue , insult ) to hoist his opinion onto others .",pos
3,cv317,24049,30,"but i like this guy , because of how black plays him .",pos
3,cv317,24049,31,"the actor is portly with a round baby face and crazy eyes , but despite his size he leaps to and fro like a manic speed freak ( which might be a bit of a redundant description , seeing as how all the speed freaks i know are manic ) .",pos
3,cv317,24049,32,he's the kind of supporting character who would be impossibly annoying comic relief in most other films .,pos
3,cv317,24049,33,( look at what that hack jan de bont did to poor phillip seymour hoffman in twister ) .,pos
3,cv317,24049,34,but fears and black never let that happen .,pos
3,cv317,24049,35,"the character , for all his shucking and jiving is steeped in reality .",pos
3,cv317,24049,36,"he's over the top , but in a way we can all probably relate to .",pos
3,cv317,24049,37,"catherine zeta-jones , in her brief role , gives a vivid portrayal of a women completely enamored with her own "" charm "" .",pos
3,cv317,24049,38,"tim robbins registers in an even tinier part as a new age-type , a character played entirely for cartoon yuks , but still manages to work its desired comic effect .",pos
3,cv317,24049,39,"the one exception in the acting department is a bit of a doozy , the main love interest played by danish actress iben hjejle ( mifune ) , who completely obliterates any trace of a danish accent , replacing it with a stilted american phonation .",pos
3,cv317,24049,40,"i give her kudos for attempting such a contradictory role , but instead of being likeable , she comes across as rather robotic , and as such it's hard to see why cusack's character would be so obsessed with her especially when he has a beautiful , intelligent writer ( natasha gregson wagner ) potentially waiting in the wings .",pos
3,cv317,24049,41,"this reminded me of say anything , where the charming cusack was paired with the charmless ione skye , and in midnight in the garden of good and evil where the poor bastard had to put up with alison eastwood ( whose unbelievably more wooden then father , clint for those "" special people "" whose wheels turn a little slower ) .",pos
3,cv317,24049,42,"in fact cusack is rarely paired up with a personality that matches his , though i'd bet that if laura and natasha switched roles , the result would be more effective .",pos
3,cv317,24049,43,high fidelity works almost entirely on the strength of its characters and performances .,pos
3,cv317,24049,44,"fears' direction is somewhat stilted , and the script is sometimes a little too ( and this is a word i'm beginning to hate to use but alas i must ) quirky for its own good ( i think i'll blame that on scott rosenberg , who judging from what he did with beautiful girls , con air , and things to do in denver while your dead , has his fingerprints all over the most irritating bits of this movie ) .",pos
3,cv317,24049,45,"but cusack really does deserve an award , for being so damn ? ? ? cusackian .",pos
3,cv317,24049,46,i'm afraid that his talents are so understated that he may have to wait till his hip needs replacing to be offered such an award worthy of his considerable talent .,pos
3,cv317,24049,47,"his character , rob ( whose sort of like an older , more bitter lloyd from say anything ) is funny and tragic without being pathetic , and that cusack can do all this , and still not imprint himself onto the minds of most audiences , is something of an achievement .",pos
3,cv318,10493,0,"only a year after the initial release of "" scream , "" the horror send-up from veteran horror director wes craven and screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed to breathe new life into the slasher genre , the inevitable sequel "" scream 2 "" has arrived in our theaters .",pos
3,cv318,10493,1,"while the tongue-in-cheek , parodic element is still noticeable in this film , it's really a sideshow to a broader commentary on violence and the media and a more conventional horror story .",pos
3,cv318,10493,2,"the first film , while often violent and gruesome , was mostly lacking in genuine scares because almost every scene was played for camp value and the discussion of the quirks and cliches of horror movies was nearly constant .",pos
3,cv318,10493,3,"the premise of "" scream 2 "" is that a series of copycat killings begin when a movie called "" stab , "" based on a book written by opportunistic reporter gail weathers ( courtney cox ) about the events in "" scream , "" is released and two audience members are killed during the opening screening .",pos
3,cv318,10493,4,i had heard about this scene before i went to see the film and was surprised to find this sequence largely lacking in camp comedy .,pos
3,cv318,10493,5,"its conclusion , in which a bleeding , wounded woman stumbles in front of the screen and dies in front of an audience that cheers on because they think it's a publicity stunt , is more surreal and disturbing than anything else .",pos
3,cv318,10493,6,"the satire in "" scream 2 "" thus takes on a broad focus and gradually evolves into an exploration of media perceptions in general .",pos
3,cv318,10493,7,"although resident horror film geek randy ( jamie kennedy ) is back with fresh dialogue about sequels ( and , interestingly enough , how they are usually inferior to their predecessors ) , the characters in this movie are drawing from other entries in the pop culture encyclopedia as well .",pos
3,cv318,10493,8,"everything from "" friends "" and "" saved by the bell "" to "" showgirls "" and "" terminator 2 "" is referenced here ; horror is only one of many genres available for lampooning , and there aren't any "" wes carpenter "" jokes this time .",pos
3,cv318,10493,9,"more importantly , this film portrays characters willing to go to disturbing lengths for media attention as well as characters whose perceptions have clearly been warped by what they have seen on tv and film .",pos
3,cv318,10493,10,"the killings are clearly an imitation of the previous murders from "" scream "" ( in fact , the culprit even plans to use the influence of horror movies as a courtroom defense ) , weathers exploits the situation for her own notoriety , and one man seems willing to save the heroine's life only if it will earn him an interview on the today show .",pos
3,cv318,10493,11,"understandably , "" scream 2 "" does not go so far as to actually blame the movies , but rather shows that those who do imitate horror movies are already sick and twisted .",pos
3,cv318,10493,12,"couple that with the fact that several of the characters , most notably the lead character sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , are fairly well-developed and that there are some genuine moments of spine-chilling suspense , and what we have is a pretty darned good horror movie in its own right .",pos
3,cv318,10493,13,"we don't just get the horror of scary masks and graphic gore - we also get the horror of sympathetic characters who seem helpless as their friends are slaughtered ( and , in one case , a significant character who was an audience favorite even bites the dust ) and whose lives have been reduced to constant fear of a crazed murderer lurking around the corner .",pos
3,cv318,10493,14,"while i have not seen any of his other work , it's easy to see why craven is generally touted as the most sophisticated "" slasher film "" director , as he clearly cares about something more than just the actual acts of slashing .",pos
3,cv318,10493,15,"unfortunately , "" scream 2 "" occasionally reverts to the time-honored horror tradition of throwing logic out the window .",pos
3,cv318,10493,16,"for example , several characters seem quite clearly dead and inexplicably turn up alive later - there has been a running gag in both movies about the villain being able to pull off this particular trick , but it also happens with other characters and in an even less believable fashion .",pos
3,cv318,10493,17,there are also a few scenes in which the killer suddenly appears behind the next victim in a situation such that ( s ) he clearly would have been seen moving in that direction .,pos

3,cv320,9530,35,"unfortunately , whenever one intelligent film comes out against special effects-laden films , it normally gets buried .",pos
3,cv320,9530,36,the second best thing about gattaca is the production design by jan roelfs .,pos

3,cv321,12843,4,"it starts with andrew niccol ( gattaca ) , who created the script ten years ago .",pos

3,cv321,12843,8,"one-upping niccol , it was when unlikely candidate-director peter weir took the helm that things fell into place .",pos
3,cv321,12843,9,"weir had the nearly impossible task to create the unimitible tone , deftly mixing capra with kafka , throwing george bailey in a universe inhabited by rod serling .",pos
3,cv321,12843,10,it was weir's first stroke of genius to create seahaven : a suburban paradise/prison that would make spielberg cower in shame .,pos
3,cv321,12843,11,"for example , bystander-extras would walk around the block incessantly with flowers along with the latest issue of _dog fancy_ .",pos

3,cv321,12843,13,credit weir for his second stroke : the casting of carrey .,pos
3,cv321,12843,14,"carrey seems to be the type of character actor who would always turn "" on "" and act goofy whenever the camera is near .",pos

3,cv321,12843,18,playing one who has the cameras constantly invading his most intimate moments turns to be quite the role of jim carrey's life .,pos
3,cv321,12843,19,no pun intended .,pos
3,cv321,12843,20,"better in a smaller , more pivotal role is ed harris as christof , who mixes the right amount of his apollo 13 "" work the problem , people "" character with dustin hoffman's megaglomaniac producer in _wag the dog_ , and then only slightly svengalian .",pos
3,cv321,12843,21,it is clear that he is torn between the nielson ratings and truman's well being .,pos

3,cv321,12843,26,laura linney ( congo ) and noah emmerich ( copland ) have the unfortunate task of playing truman's wife and best friend ; their sitcom-ish dialogue allow little room for any authentic character development .,pos
3,cv321,12843,27,"the exception is at the very beginning , where they speak into the camera , wholeheartedly believing that their participation is truly good for truman , and for society in general .",pos
3,cv321,12843,28,there are other little problems with the script .,pos
3,cv321,12843,29,are we to assume that toddler truman had no recollection of hearing the construction of such a gigantic dome during his formative years ?,pos
3,cv321,12843,30,"was there any reason as to why in one scene , it rained solely on truman , even though it never had to ?",pos
3,cv321,12843,31,"how is it they hire hundreds of extras , and none of them could drive a boat , and yet truman , fearful of water , is helming a sailboat effortlessly ?",pos
3,cv321,12843,32,"and couldn't christof have turned off the wind , to strand truman at sea ?",pos
3,cv321,12843,33,"these little contrivances , however , do not hold a candle to the overall effect of the work .",pos
3,cv321,12843,34,"the audience gets the feeling that it is watching the actual show , and we are drawn to truman's mundane existence for no other reason than it is there .",pos
3,cv321,12843,35,the final result effortlessly combines the emotional happy ending of a mainstream picture with a gnawing discomfort that hits you square in the gut .,pos
3,cv321,12843,36,"upon leaving the theater , i was looking up in the sky , wondering if it was nothing more than a gigantic dome .",pos

3,cv322,20318,2,the exciting jaws 2 . the rather flaky jaws 3d and sometime in the late 90s another film of the same genre that i can't seem to recall ( about the son of jaws returning to wreak revenge or something like that ) .,pos

3,cv328,10373,46,"compared to pulp fiction ( comparison #3 ) , the characters in jackie brown and very thin and replaceable .",pos
3,cv328,10373,47,"in pulp fiction , even the small , seemingly irrelevant characters were wonderful , complete , and lifelike , whereas jackie brown has such common figures that it wouldn't have suffered much with a lesser talented cast , the exception being grier .",pos
3,cv328,10373,48,"tarantino wrote this script with grier specifically in mind , so to say that she is made for this role is a reversed truth .",pos
3,cv328,10373,49,"sadly , grier too could have received a bit more attention , especially when the story is all about her newly-jarred perception of life .",pos
3,cv328,10373,50,"jackson teams up with tarantino again , but the chemical reaction isn't as awesome as the first time .",pos
3,cv328,10373,51,"jules was the rambling , bible-quoting hitman in pulp fiction , and jackson is the only person who could have pulled it off .",pos

3,cv328,10373,53,"in fact , maybe a new face would have been better .",pos
3,cv328,10373,54,"jackson could've remained tarantino's jules , and a new guy could have become ordell , forever to remain so in our memories .",pos
3,cv328,10373,55,"sadly , these characters are too much the same , except ordell just isn't as impressive , and putting this in the hands of jackson once again is only going to deter from our fond recollections of jules .",pos
3,cv328,10373,56,another problem is that ordell is way too focused on in the beginning .,pos
3,cv328,10373,57,"this is grier's film , so why spend so long getting to know a man who will become more of a supporting character as the film progresses ?",pos
3,cv328,10373,58,"it not only makes the movie feel a little too slanted , but it makes for a slow beginning because we have to take longer getting to the meat of the story .",pos
3,cv328,10373,59,"it is likely that those pouring into the theater to see this film are going to be those anxious to partake of tarantino's quirky dialogue and eccentric directing style , and not so much those interested in seeing a silver screen adaption of elmore leonard's novel "" rum punch "" .",pos
3,cv328,10373,60,"for those movie-goers , don't expect another pulp fiction and you'll be satisfied , for the script oozes with the familiar brash qualities that has made tarantino an icon of 90's film- making .",pos
3,cv328,10373,61,"the directing has toned down a bit , however , yet we're still reminded that this is tarantino's movie thanks to odd split-screen story-telling devices and scenes being replayed multiple times from different viewpoints .",pos
3,cv328,10373,62,"so getting back to the question that i began with , this isn't pulp fiction at all .",pos
3,cv328,10373,63,"it's good , but it isn't anything that made pulp fiction such a revolutionary effort in the first place .",pos
3,cv328,10373,64,"this is a more conservative tarantino , but not one that won't satiate true fans .",pos

3,cv329,29370,9,"nicholson is fantastic , portraying black with rare subtlety and animus ; jerry's gradual descent into obsession is like a car wreck , a thing horrible to look at but impossible to turn away from .",pos

3,cv329,29370,11,"only eckhart disappoints as jerry's replacement , stan ; he never seems entirely convincing , too much a tool of the plot .",pos

3,cv330,29809,18,immediately it is obvious that there is more going on than meets the eye .,pos
3,cv330,29809,19,much of what distinguishes heist is mamet's dialog .,pos
3,cv330,29809,20,remarkably it serves a double purpose .,pos

3,cv330,29809,26,"both are good films , perhaps for some of the same reasons .",pos
3,cv330,29809,27,but at least on a high level they are much the same story .,pos
3,cv330,29809,28,the other problem with the timing of heist is that it involves airport security and clever ways to get around them .,pos
3,cv330,29809,29,"i saw the film at the toronto international film festival on september 12 , 2001 .",pos
3,cv330,29809,30,that made the subject matter just a little too timely .,pos
3,cv330,29809,31,my understanding is that the release will be delayed .,pos
3,cv330,29809,32,my biggest problem with the film is that rebecca pidgeon's acting at times seems very poor .,pos

3,cv330,29809,34,it is an irritation and distracts us from what is otherwise a very good thriller .,pos

3,cv331,8273,2,it is a movie for all ages .,pos
3,cv331,8273,3,--a review by stuart cracraft,pos
3,cv331,8273,4,"contact starring : jodie foster , matthew mcconaughey , john hurt director : robert zemeckis star",pos
3,cv331,8273,5,"after a predictable mit phillip morrison powers-of-10 zoom-out start ( which can be surprising to those not familiar with prof . morrison's work ) , contact picks up steam , gradually , building , by-the-end , an irresistable juggernaut and a very good movie that does not as is so often the case fall out-of-balance in terms of too much pandering to the technological "" geek "" side .",pos
3,cv331,8273,6,"by the end , the audience is left with what good science fiction is supposed to do : evoke a sense of wonder about the universe and evoke questions in your mind about what's out there .",pos
3,cv331,8273,7,this movie does not let technology overshadow characterization and in this sense it is unusual amongst high-tech movies .,pos
3,cv331,8273,8,"however , except for jodie foster ( elie arroway ) and john hurt ( s . r .",pos
3,cv331,8273,9,"hadden ) , who are both actors of exceptional caliber , the supporting cast are not especially impressive .",pos
3,cv331,8273,10,hurt certainly has had better roles ( stephen ward in scandal ) .,pos
3,cv331,8273,11,"this one , as the multi-billionare hadden , does not do his acting skills justice .",pos
3,cv331,8273,12,this is clearly a foster movie by one of the great hollywood lights of our generation .,pos
3,cv331,8273,13,foster's radiance has never been more strong than in the scene where she finally meets the vegans on their terms .,pos
3,cv331,8273,14,"early scenes take a long , long time to build up to this .",pos
3,cv331,8273,15,the movie's pacing is very good and subtle .,pos
3,cv331,8273,16,the panoramas of the radio dishes at arecibo and ceti in new mexico and puerto rico are beautiful .,pos
3,cv331,8273,17,the politics of foster's character attempting to obtain funding for research at these places are trite and predictable however .,pos
3,cv331,8273,18,"one of the most entertaining , but very short scenes , is when foster is confronted by rob lowe , during a cabinet-level presidential meeting to discuss the alien invitation .",pos
3,cv331,8273,19,there were real sparks in this scene between foster and lowe and it would behoove them to consider other vehicles in which this dynamism could be explored .,pos
3,cv331,8273,20,it is the only scene in the movie in which there were tremendous dynamics between two characters .,pos
3,cv331,8273,21,everything else was very one-sided ( e . g .,pos
3,cv331,8273,22,foster ) .,pos
3,cv331,8273,23,lowe can stand up to foster and it showed in that scene at the cabinet table .,pos
3,cv331,8273,24,the core scene of the movie is set on a surrealistic beach on a far-away world in the starsystem of vega .,pos
3,cv331,8273,25,"it feels a lot like science fiction writer john varley's scenes in his book steel beach , where the female protagonists encounters an immensely superior intelligence , in one case a computer manufactured by mankind itself , and in foster's case , an illusion drawn from her memory .",pos
3,cv331,8273,26,"in another sense , this immensely moving scene evokes gene roddenberry's star trek pilot the cage , later the menagerie , when jeffrey hunter and susan oliver have their memories manipulated to create new worlds in which they live and encounter aliens .",pos
3,cv331,8273,27,"the concept is not new , by any sense , in the world of science fiction .",pos
3,cv331,8273,28,"but the beach scene , which is the centerpiece of the film , as is the whole film , is driven by foster .",pos
3,cv331,8273,29,"freed from her needs to direct by director zemecki , foster is able to let it all hang out in the characterization and the lead she provides to her supporting cast .",pos
3,cv331,8273,30,"as the movie gains speed , foster's acting intensifies and the audience really does experience it with her .",pos
3,cv331,8273,31,"it is certainly oscar-caliber acting , unquestionably .",pos
3,cv331,8273,32,"the supporting cast does well and zemeckis throws in some humor with some president clinton cameos , cleverly manipulated , george stephanopolus-style , to seem very forrest gump .",pos

3,cv331,8273,34,al .,pos
3,cv331,8273,35,"got in trouble for the usage of some of the footage seen in the movie , vis a vis clinton .",pos
3,cv331,8273,36,but the audience i attended this movie with just had some good chuckles at clinton's walk-ons .,pos
3,cv331,8273,37,the much-discussed tension between science and religion in this movie is not particularly insightful to those who have already gone through this course though it is helpful to those in the audience who have not .,pos
3,cv331,8273,38,"also , the near-final scene , in a senate judiciary hearing room is disappointing .",pos
3,cv331,8273,39,"contact is a fitting memorial to the memory of carl sagan , science popularizer , and sometime pedantic gadfly of the halls of academe .",pos

3,cv332,16307,1,"since "" awakenings "" was so very good , and made my top ten list the year it was released , "" at first sight "" is not quite as strong since it is not directed with as sure a hand as penny marshall , but is still an intelligent and vibrantly-acted drama .",pos

3,cv332,16307,6,"at first reluctant , virgil finally travels with amy to nyc and agrees to the surgery , much to the hesitance of his overbearing , but loving older sister ( kelly mcgillis ) .",pos
3,cv332,16307,7,"ultimately , the surgery is a success , but problems arise since virgil cannot relate to what he sees , since he has never visually seen anything before , only touched objects .",pos
3,cv332,16307,8,"he moves into amy's apartment and she is eager to stand by him , but virgil's maladjustment begins to put a strain on their relationship .",pos
3,cv332,16307,9,"on the basis of the overall story , "" at first sight "" is indeed a film that has been done many times before , and owes a great deal to its predecessor , "" awakenings . """,pos
3,cv332,16307,10,what will happen throughout the film can also be easily telegraphed in advance .,pos
3,cv332,16307,11,"however , what helps "" at first sight "" rise above this predictability is in the mature and intelligent relationship that develops between virgil and amy .",pos
3,cv332,16307,12,"usually , romantic pictures are of the shameless puppy-dog sort ( the recent tom hanks/meg ryan-starrer "" you've got mail "" immediately pops to mind ) , but with this film , i grew to care more about the characters and their plight .",pos
3,cv332,16307,13,the film starts off noticably well as amy travels up north and first meets virgil .,pos
3,cv332,16307,14,"the massaging sequences were strangely erotic , maybe even more so than the later actual "" love scenes , "" and as their romantic involvement quickly developed , the film was both entertaining and sweet , and there was clearly a lot of chemistry between the two .",pos
3,cv332,16307,15,"these joyous moments early on balanced out well with the later scenes in which their relationship is seriously tested due to a contrast in the life styles that they have always known , with virgil completely used to being blind and having a comforting , peaceful life in the country to amy's eventful life in the "" big city . """,pos
3,cv332,16307,16,the other major compliment that must be given to the film are the nearly flawless performances across the board .,pos
3,cv332,16307,17,"val kilmer , usually cast in the "" macho "" type of role , was always believable as a blind person , and playing his character was probably a little more tricky than it appears .",pos
3,cv332,16307,18,"it was up to kilmer to not come off as someone to pity , but to sympathize with , and he pulled it off .",pos
3,cv332,16307,19,"mira sorvino , who made a spectacular debuting splash in 1995's hilarious woody allen comedy , "" mighty aphrodite , "" for which she won a well-deserved oscar as a kind-hearted , but ditzy hooker , is a standout here .",pos
3,cv332,16307,20,"although she has made some mediocre film choices since then ( 1997's "" mimic , "" 1998's "" the replacement killers "" ) , she always has managed to come out unscathed , and it is with "" at first sight "" that she finally has another juicy role to play .",pos
3,cv332,16307,21,"in a truthful climactic scene set in amy's apartment between she and virgil , sorvino proves to be one of the most gifted young actresses around today , and has a flare for both comedic and dramatic pieces .",pos
3,cv332,16307,22,"kelly mcgillis , who could have easily come off as the "" bad , "" one-dimensional sister , instead is also given an unexpectedly multifaceted character to play as a woman who may be overly protective but simply cares for her brother .",pos
3,cv332,16307,23,"finally , nathan lane , who is usually a little too over-the-top , is appropriately restrained as a vision therapist .",pos
3,cv332,16307,24,"the one misstep of "" at first sight "" is in its treatment of the medical procedure done on virgil .",pos
3,cv332,16307,25,"very little is ever said or discussed concerning it , and when the surgery occurs , it is so briefly glimpsed at that it is impossible to see what is being done to his eyes .",pos
3,cv332,16307,26,"perhaps the reason this aspect of the film was not more in-depth was that the makers were afraid it would gross out audiences , but i would personally take realism , even if it is graphic , any day over simply giving the explanation of the surgery the cold shoulder .",pos
3,cv332,16307,27,"in "" awakenings , "" the patients and illness were far more satisfyingly portrayed .",pos
3,cv332,16307,28,"because of how strong the screenplay , written by steve levitt , is in the way it deals with the main relationship , and because of the fabulous performances from kilmer and sorvino , the film's few problems can be swept over to the side .",pos
3,cv332,16307,29,"the adult way that the romance is depicted by director irwin winkler is , no doubt , in respect to the real-life couple that the film was inspired by , who are still together after many years ( even though the setting of the film was changed to new york ) .",pos
3,cv332,16307,30,"since january is usually the time of year that is known as the dumping ground from bad movies , "" at first sight "" comes as a refreshing and sophisticated change of pace .",pos

3,cv335,14665,1,"on the one hand , the film manages to recreate key moments from the novel , evoking morrison's pragmatic narrative style without using her authorial voice .",pos
3,cv335,14665,2,"on the other hand , beloved omits the some of the finer details of the book , favoring an ambiguously defined back story upon which to build the story's main events .",pos

3,cv335,14665,9,"_beloved_ ultimately tells the story of sethe's search for forgiveness , one long-hampered by an unforgettable sin .",pos
3,cv335,14665,10,"the film starts off on a dreary day ten years after sethe's escape , as a violent , unseen energy rocks her dilapidated farmhouse .",pos

3,cv335,14665,12,"sethe's sons run away , perhaps for good , leaving sethe and her daughter denver to fend for themselves .",pos
3,cv335,14665,13,demme's matter-of-fact handling of this supernatural element is just one of _beloved_'s intriguing aspects .,pos

3,cv335,14665,15,"when paul d ( danny glover ) -- a former slave who escaped kentucky along with sethe -- arrives at the house eight years later and is confronted with the ghost's hellish visions , he doesn't run in terror .",pos
3,cv335,14665,16,"instead , he asks who the ghost is .",pos
3,cv335,14665,17,"as in morrison's novel , demme quickly establishes that the horror of the story will not come from the fact of the ghost itself , but from the terrifying past in which the ghost was created .",pos
3,cv335,14665,18,"sethe is the one being haunted , but the ghost in the house is the least of her fears .",pos
3,cv335,14665,19,"in fact , the ghost is one of the reasons she chooses to stay .",pos

3,cv335,14665,30,the film's least palatable choice of casting is unfortunately that of the role of beloved herself .,pos
3,cv335,14665,31,"thandie newton plays the glassy-eyed girl with a demented fervor which is endearing at first , but which becomes off-putting and unintentionally laughable by the end .",pos
3,cv335,14665,32,"departing from the honed aesthetic he used in such films as _the silence of the lambs_ and _melvin & howard_ , director demme has used a bit of dramatic overstatement to get across the vivid descriptions in morrison's novel .",pos
3,cv335,14665,33,"totemic camera shots and color-saturated scenery are decidedly uncommon in demme's films , but the few he uses here work to the film's benefit .",pos
3,cv335,14665,34,"_beloved_'s most memorable scenes are those of baby suggs' gatherings in a forest clearing , where the bright yellow-greens of nature entrance the viewer as much as suggs' words do .",pos
3,cv335,14665,35,"for the most part , though , demme maintains his trademark directorial neutrality .",pos
3,cv335,14665,36,"this , combined with morrison's equally frugal method of storytelling , may make _beloved_ somewhat of a challenge to watch , even to those familiar with the book .",pos
3,cv335,14665,37,"though the film compliments the book extraordinarily well , it falls short in allowing the sort of accessibility one usually expects from a film .",pos
3,cv335,14665,38,nothing is spoon-fed to the viewer .,pos
3,cv335,14665,39,"morrison's novel is just as enigmatic , but unlike a movie , a book can be put down to allow the various undercurrents and themes to churn and absorb .",pos

3,cv336,10143,0,"scream 2 isn't quite as clever as its predecessor , but it fills the gap with a cutting wit .",pos
3,cv336,10143,1,"death -- even gruesome , bloody death -- can be funny if handled the right way ( some will be offended by this statement , but you need look no further than pulp fiction for an example ) .",pos
3,cv336,10143,2,"and , while there's plenty of horror to go around in scream 2 , the latest '90s slasher flick incarnation , there are also a few laughs to be had .",pos
3,cv336,10143,3,scream 2 is a slice-and-dice movie for those who don't take their horror too seriously .,pos
3,cv336,10143,4,the success of the original scream took everyone in the industry by surprise .,pos
3,cv336,10143,5,"the unexpected blockbuster , whose gross soared over the $100 million mark during its six month release window , opened just about a year ago and turned into one of the most profitable horror films of all time .",pos

3,cv336,10143,7,"as stipulated by one of the "" rules of sequels "" uttered by a movie- obsessed character in the film , the body count in scream 2 is higher than that in the original .",pos

3,cv336,10143,9,"there is blood , of course , but nothing excessive by slasher-movie standards , and there are no depictions of spilled entrails .",pos
3,cv336,10143,10,craven has remembered that scares are more important that graphic displays of human insides and bodily fluids .,pos
3,cv336,10143,11,a second strength of scream 2 is that it features a gallery of legitimate characters rather than a group of cardboard cut-out stereotypes lined up for slaughter .,pos
3,cv336,10143,12,"after all , we've known some of these people for two movies -- it's almost impossible not to care about them at least a little .",pos

3,cv336,10143,16,"some of the smartest dialogue comes during this sequence as pinkett bemoans the lack of african american participation in horror films ( it's surely no coincidence that , in addition to pinkett and epps , scream 2 features two black characters ) .",pos

3,cv344,5312,5,"like a certain oversized teenage movie critic , she is intelligent and has a great sense of humor but strikes out with the opposite sex because she sees herself as physically unattractive , and the men seem to be backing her up on that .",pos
3,cv344,5312,6,"meanwhile , her gorgeous neighbor nora ( uma thurman . . .",pos

3,cv344,5312,19,"the charade continues , with abby furthering the relationship over the phone ( including a decidedly unnecessary phone sex/masturbation sequence ) and nora furthering it in person , while eventually finding herself attracted to the dog man .",pos
3,cv344,5312,20,"like sleepless in seattle , this comedy/romance is predictable all the way through , but we care enough about the characters that we root them on and will the romance to blossom .",pos
3,cv344,5312,21,"the truth about cats and dogs isn't quite as entertaining as i was expecting it to be , but it handles well a theme i could identify with .",pos
3,cv344,5312,22,"the thing is , i find janeane garafolo rather attractive .",pos
3,cv344,5312,23,she's no uma but i'm sure in real life she'd have no problems attracting men .,pos

3,cv345,9954,2,"of course , i was expecting aliens again , and i believe this was my fault .",pos
3,cv345,9954,3,"in order to appreciate alien 3 , you need to see aliens , but you also have to wipe away all the expectations from its predecessor .",pos
3,cv345,9954,4,"james cameron's aliens was an action film , and many people consider it the best in the series .",pos
3,cv345,9954,5,"i am among that group , but alien 3 is an extremely entertaining film , which critics have bashed for its originality .",pos
3,cv345,9954,6,"many thought the final chase scene went on for too long , and many others thought that the film was too much dialogue and not enough action .",pos
3,cv345,9954,7,"both are untrue , because the film has quite a bit of action , and the dialogue was essential and well-written .",pos
3,cv345,9954,8,"as for the chase sequence , it was long , but not overly long , creating quite a bit of suspense from confusion .",pos
3,cv345,9954,9,perhaps watching alien 3 on video helped .,pos
3,cv345,9954,10,"on the big screen , i was overwhelmed by something i normally didn't see .",pos
3,cv345,9954,11,"it was a very dark film , and the language was extremely harsh .",pos
3,cv345,9954,12,i had always figured the alien series to rely on smart dialogue instead of moronic profanities .,pos
3,cv345,9954,13,"don't get me wrong--i'm not saying films should eliminate swearing , but when a film substitutes dialogue with these profane remarks , it gets rather distracting .",pos
3,cv345,9954,14,"however , since seeing it again , i realize that the swearing is mainly just an aspect of the restrained hatred in the characters .",pos
3,cv345,9954,15,"as a result , alien 3's only flaw ( albeit a major one ) is the underdeveloped characters .",pos
3,cv345,9954,16,"we never really care about any of them , and i get the feeling that many scenes were cut in order to shorten the length of the movie .",pos
3,cv345,9954,17,"there were only two characters i liked , and of course one was lt . ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , although we have gotten to know her through two other films .",pos
3,cv345,9954,18,"the other character was dr . clemens ( charles dance ) , but because we like him , the inevitable occurs .",pos
3,cv345,9954,19,alien 3 begins exactly where aliens left off .,pos
3,cv345,9954,20,"the prologue of alien 3 is a pure cinematic achievement by director david fincher , who had only directed music videos before his chance with this alien entry .",pos
3,cv345,9954,21,"without using a single line of dialogue ( unless you count computer warnings ) , fincher sets up the entire film .",pos
3,cv345,9954,22,an impressive aspect of this is that fincher only shows a few seconds of film before cutting to a title card .,pos
3,cv345,9954,23,we see lt . ripley and the little girl in their cryogenic compartments . . .,pos

3,cv345,9954,30,"during these first ten minutes , i learned everything i had to in order for alien 3 to proceed .",pos
3,cv345,9954,31,"it's quite a remarkable opening , and one which will remain in my mind for a long time .",pos
3,cv345,9954,32,"because of this face-hugger which has been hatched aboard the vessel from aliens , the hypersleep containers are sent into an escape pod , and sent down to the nearest planet : fiorina fury-161 , an ore refinery which has been turned into a maximum security prison .",pos
3,cv345,9954,33,"however , the face-hugger managed to attach itself to one of the cryo-tubes , and is sent down with the escape pod .",pos
3,cv345,9954,34,"unfortunately , during the landing , all but one of the survivors from aliens is killed .",pos
3,cv345,9954,35,ripley is discovered by some of the inmates and taken back to the refinery .,pos
3,cv345,9954,36,"of course , you need a carrier for this face-hugger , and it attachs itself to the dog which came with the team of inmates .",pos
3,cv345,9954,37,ripley is revived and asks to see the ship .,pos
3,cv345,9954,38,"after seeing a mysterious acid-eaten section , ripley asks to see the dead bodies , and then have them cremated .",pos
3,cv345,9954,39,this cremation scene is one of the most powerful and impressive of all the alien films .,pos
3,cv345,9954,40,"featuring a monologue from dillon ( charles s . dutton ) , a prisoner who has found god , the movie cuts back and forth from the ceremony to the dog's demise .",pos
3,cv345,9954,41,"it's one of the most memorable moments , as the speech reflects exactly what is going on with the dog .",pos
3,cv345,9954,42,and this is where alien 3 succeeds .,pos
3,cv345,9954,43,"fincher normally injects a lot of symbolism into his films , and i can easily see him becoming the next stanley kubrick or alfred hitchcock ( in fact , he is the mixture of both ) .",pos
3,cv345,9954,44,"fincher knows exactly what to film and how to film it , and i figure that he will be one of the few directors with complete control over his films .",pos
3,cv345,9954,45,alien 3 is riddled with symbolic speeches and metaphorical images .,pos
3,cv345,9954,46,"by doing so , fincher creates some of the best scenes in the entire alien franchise .",pos
3,cv345,9954,47,"many people have criticized fincher's filming of the death scene of ripley ( i reveal nothing by saying this ) as looking too fake , but i enjoy and relish in the portrayal .",pos
3,cv345,9954,48,"showing ripley fall in slow motion is a nice touch , but by actually not showing her hit the vat of iron , a great deal of symbolism is derived .",pos
3,cv345,9954,49,i feel that it would have spoiled the mood of the entire film if they had actually shown her splash into the molten iron .,pos
3,cv345,9954,50,"however , most people seem to want to witness ripley die ( which creates a paradox , as she is the character i didn't want to see die ) .",pos
3,cv345,9954,51,"why she is killed is one of the surprises of the film , and i don't plan on spoiling that in this review .",pos
3,cv345,9954,52,>from every alien film comes several memorable moments which seem to stick with you forever .,pos
3,cv345,9954,53,"in alien , it was , of course , the moment the alien burst out of kane's stomach .",pos
3,cv345,9954,54,"in aliens , it was the showdown between alien and ripley in a machine .",pos
3,cv345,9954,55,"alien 3 has several , but most memorable is the terrific shot involving the alien and ripley .",pos
3,cv345,9954,56,"ripley is pushed up against a wall , and the alien stands inches away from her .",pos
3,cv345,9954,57,"why it doesn't kill her is a shocker , which later leads to a surprise ending .",pos
3,cv345,9954,58,"fincher apparently loves to use close-ups of actors' faces ( michael douglas and the clown face-off in the game in the same style ) , and by shaving off the actors' hair , the only thing we have to look at is their faces .",pos
3,cv345,9954,59,"many critics didn't like all the actors being bald , but it makes complete sense when taken in context of the plot .",pos
3,cv345,9954,60,"most of alien 3 works when you take it in context of the story , but when you try to compare it to its predecessors , fincher's turn seems a bit gloomy and dark , though that's not always a bad thing .",pos
3,cv345,9954,61,"the plot is pretty much a rehash of the first two films , with some major twists .",pos
3,cv345,9954,62,"again , we are setup with several different characters , and one by one , they are picked off .",pos
3,cv345,9954,63,"however , while the first two had tons of arsenal ( especially cameron's film ) , alien 3 takes place on a planet devoid of human life except for this run-down prison .",pos
3,cv345,9954,64,"as a result , no weapons are to be found .",pos
3,cv345,9954,65,"this creates a lot of tension , although i must admit that fincher could have added a lot more suspense .",pos
3,cv345,9954,66,"as an alien film , alien 3 is the worst of the series , but by itself , it is an extremely well-made motion picture , with a lot more merits than not .",pos
3,cv345,9954,67,the unfortunate thing surrounding this second sequel is the one-dimensional characters .,pos
3,cv345,9954,68,i never was really emotionally involved on screen because most of the characters are hardcore criminals whom i really could care less about .,pos
3,cv345,9954,69,"despite this , ripley was the central figure , and that's what is important .",pos
3,cv345,9954,70,"we care for her , even though she began to act just like one of the guys .",pos
3,cv345,9954,71,"again , the technical side of this film is remarkable , and better than the two previous versions .",pos
3,cv345,9954,72,"while cameron's version was a pumped up action film with massive artillary , fincher uses brilliant camera angles , terrific lighting , and moody sets .",pos
3,cv345,9954,73,"the cinematography , by alex thomson , is very well done , with a terrific chase sequence towards the end of the movie .",pos
3,cv345,9954,74,"the confusion of the ending draws the viewer in , as we are just as confused as the actors who are being chased around .",pos
3,cv345,9954,75,"the yellows , reds , and oranges of the lights create a dark mood , and by themselves create a lot of suspense .",pos
3,cv345,9954,76,"shadows dance on the walls , and yet those shadows could easily be the alien .",pos
3,cv345,9954,77,"the alien is different from its predecessors this time around , and the swiftness of this alien is quite intense .",pos
3,cv345,9954,78,"the camera likes to take up the perspective of the alien , racing after the characters .",pos
3,cv345,9954,79,"the sets are quite incredible , which are reminiscient of the nostromo from alien .",pos
3,cv345,9954,80,the narrow corridors and labrynthine hallways is well constructed .,pos
3,cv345,9954,81,"the sets appear to be in the future , but not too far in the future .",pos
3,cv345,9954,82,one of the set pieces even aids in the destruction of the alien ( nothing surprising there ) .,pos
3,cv345,9954,83,"sigourney weaver turns out yet another good performance , equaling her portrayal of ripley in aliens .",pos
3,cv345,9954,84,"she was snubbed at the oscars for this one , mainly because the film was a critical bomb .",pos
3,cv345,9954,85,"her reactions are far more realistic in this film , with her crying over the loss of the little child she risked her life saving in her previous encounter .",pos
3,cv345,9954,86,it's quite touching really .,pos
3,cv345,9954,87,"charles s . dutton is very strong in his performance as one of the inmates , and i was on the brink of actually caring for him .",pos
3,cv345,9954,88,"charles dance turns in a nice low-key performance , and as a result , i cared for him immediately .",pos
3,cv345,9954,89,"lance henriksen makes a brief appearance as bishop ii , but he was more entertaining in aliens .",pos
3,cv345,9954,90,"the rest of the cast is pretty stale , though pete postlethwaite sticks out due to his recent turns in the usual suspects and the lost world .",pos
3,cv345,9954,91,"alien 3 is rated r for strong violence and language , and sex .",pos
3,cv345,9954,92,"although it has its flaws , alien 3 is highly entertaining with rich symbolism .",pos
3,cv345,9954,93,this film reminds you how much fun it is to spot metaphorical images throughout a movie .,pos
3,cv345,9954,94,"while kubrick may have a moral message throughout his films , fincher relies on cinematic devices to bring his meanings out .",pos
3,cv345,9954,95,it's a film like fincher's which reminds us that it is okay for a film to sacrifice quality for quantity ( the final scene ) .,pos
3,cv345,9954,96,"in fact , it tells us that we , as a society , have become too critical of things which may happen to look a little "" fake . """,pos
3,cv345,9954,97,"whenever something looks fake on screen , we immediately point it out as a mistake .",pos
3,cv345,9954,98,but perhaps it isn't a mistake .,pos
3,cv346,18168,0,"ultra low budget but extremely inventive horror film about a group of friends vacationing in a cabin who accidentally awaken an evil force in the woods via the necronomicon , the book of the dead .",pos
3,cv346,18168,1,"bruce campbell stars as ash , who eventually becomes the sole survivor and has to battle both the demons from the woods , and his friends who have become demons ( including his own girlfriend ) .",pos
3,cv346,18168,2,"the results shown on screen are amazing considering the film's tiny budget , constant location changes , and a filming schedule that was sporadic over two years .",pos
3,cv346,18168,3,followed by two sequels : evil dead ii ( 1987 ) and army of darkness ( 1993 ) .,pos
3,cv346,18168,4,the dvd release of this film from elite entertainment contains the film in it's original aspect ratio of 1 . 33 : 1 .,pos
3,cv346,18168,5,the disc contains two versions of the film's audio : a stereo 2 . 0 track and a newly remastered dolby digital 5 . 1 .,pos
3,cv346,18168,6,"included are two separate running commentary tracks : the first features writer/director sam raimi and producer rob tapert and the second track features the film's star , bruce campbell .",pos
3,cv346,18168,7,"campbell's commentary is informative and extremely witty , as he has a story to tell for virtually every scene in the film .",pos
3,cv346,18168,8,"such informative tidbits include : the original title of the film was going to be book of the dead ( and in fact when the film premiered in 1981 that was it's title ) and when they were asked to change the title to the evil dead , everyone thought it was the worst title they had ever heard .",pos
3,cv346,18168,9,"also , there's a scene early on in the film where the group sits around and listens to a tape recorder which they've found that's explaining about the demonic forces in the woods .",pos
3,cv346,18168,10,"for that scene , it was written for the characters to be smoking marijuana , so being the wacky kids that they were at the time , they decided to actually smoke marijuana for the scene .",pos
3,cv346,18168,11,"almost all of that footage became unusable because many of the actor's had never smoked before , and as a result they became "" confused "" and were unable to perform the scene .",pos
3,cv346,18168,12,i wish the entertainment factor was as high for the sam raimi/rob tapert audio track .,pos
3,cv346,18168,13,the two people you'd think would be more enthusiastic in talking about this film instead barely have much to say at all .,pos
3,cv346,18168,14,"don't get me wrong here , when they do speak it's entertaining to hear , but there are many instances where both are silent for long periods of time .",pos
3,cv346,18168,15,"sometimes after one of those long silences rob will ask "" have anything to say sam ? """,pos
3,cv346,18168,16,"to me , that's not a good sign .",pos
3,cv346,18168,17,"also , it seems like sam raimi doesn't remember much about the film and it's production . . .",pos
3,cv346,18168,18,"well , compared to rob and bruce anyway .",pos
3,cv346,18168,19,"also included on the disc is a photo gallery ( which includes pictures from the film's "" gala "" premiere ) and about twenty minutes of raw footage from the film .",pos
3,cv346,18168,20,this raw footage really shows you how much a film can be improved upon using simple audio techniques .,pos
3,cv346,18168,21,"overall , the evil dead is a good low budget horror film , superior to many films in it's genre .",pos
3,cv346,18168,22,and the collector's edition dvd release is well worth your time if you're either a fan of the film or just a fan of the filmmaking process .,pos

3,cv347,13194,13,"he blends into his role here perfectly as the risk taking jack foley , who's willing to gamble everything on the chance that karen sisco might be his true love .",pos

3,cv349,13507,2,"scorsese views the dalai lama the way many tibetans probably do , as a larger-than-life symbol of buddhist spirituality and political leadership : the only glimpses into his head come from several interesting yet oblique dream sequences , but his portrayal is appropriate for a film that concentrates on the political and spiritual rather than the personal .",pos

3,cv351,15458,11,i didn't much care about the characters ( perhaps aside for elizabeth who is played quite well by blanchett ) and so i didn't have much interest in who would join her in her nuptials .,pos

3,cv354,8132,5,"so why , you may ask after watching it , does it seem so new and original ?",pos
3,cv354,8132,6,"because it treats itself as if it hasn't been done before , and thus the viewer is disilusioned into believing that it is not old , familar tired stuff .",pos
3,cv354,8132,7,this raises another question : how does it do this ?,pos
3,cv354,8132,8,simple : the characters .,pos
3,cv354,8132,9,they're not your typical stupid horror film victims who don't know what the hell to do when being chased by a guy in a ski mask and a machette .,pos
3,cv354,8132,10,"they are horror fans , they know how stuff happens in a horror movie , they know what to do and what not to do , and that makes it scary , and even funny at certain times .",pos

3,cv357,13156,3,"in modern times , fairy tales have become disneyfied and debased ; they have become trite adventures involving leering witches , friendly dwarves , and cuddly talking animals .",pos

3,cv357,13156,8,"before this trend was in vogue , angela carter--whose stories always have a dark , wicked , subversive edge--had been reinventing fairy tales for years .",pos
3,cv357,13156,9,"in the company of wolves , she and neil jordan retell the story of red riding hood , enlivening it with werewolves , rolls royces , and a visit from satan .",pos
3,cv357,13156,10,"the story is structured as a dream , occurring in the mind of rosaleen ( sarah patterson ) , an adolescent girl about whose 'real' life we learn very little .",pos
3,cv357,13156,11,"within the dream , there are a number of inset stories , most told by dream-rosaleen's grandmother ( angela lansbury ) , and these tales gloss the central story in intriguing , suggestive ways .",pos
3,cv357,13156,12,"the result is a surprisingly successful example of a sinister , contemporary fairy tale .",pos
3,cv357,13156,13,"i say "" surprisingly "" because there are so many ways this film could have gone wrong .",pos

3,cv357,13156,15,"the performances are mediocre , except for lansbury's--she finds the right note for the prim , apple-cheeked granny , the wise and stern teller of cautionary tales .",pos
3,cv357,13156,16,"the soundtrack , synth-heavy , reminded me of bad 80s horror movies , as did the special effects in the shapechanging scenes .",pos
3,cv357,13156,17,"probably state-of-the-art at the time , they are now laughable .",pos
3,cv357,13156,18,"but jordan succeeds at what i consider the trickiest aspect of the film : he transcends the poor acting/music/effects and conveys a sense of the fantastic , of otherness .",pos
3,cv357,13156,19,"one of the problems in adapting full-blown fantasies is that fantasy is often best left to the imagination of the reader , rather than being subjected to the 'realism' of the screen .",pos
3,cv357,13156,20,"part of me would love to see an adaptation of 'the lord of the rings , ' but , on the other hand , i know that any filmmaker's recreation of ents , hobbits , and balrogs is inevitably going to be really lame compared to what i picture in my mind .",pos
3,cv357,13156,21,this makes jordan's accomplishment here seem mighty impressive to me : he imbues the company of wolves with a genuine sense of magic and mystery .,pos

3,cv357,13156,27,"for carter , the cauldron of story is a witches' brew , bubbling over with primal ingredients : mist-shrouded forests , ancient graveyards , virginal girls and wise women , wolves with glowing eyes .",pos
3,cv357,13156,28,she adeptly blends them all together .,pos
3,cv357,13156,29,there is a symbolic richness to the film ; everything is permeated with a sense of significance .,pos
3,cv357,13156,30,"the point of it all , i think , is to represent a girl's rites-of-passage on an unconscious , primordial level .",pos
3,cv357,13156,31,"a night-journey through the forest , from the village to the grandmother's home , is the crux of the company of wolves .",pos

3,cv369,12886,26,this convincing reality of television as progenitor of reality is a magical and provocative concept ; the best thing jim carrey does is stay out of its way .,pos
3,cv369,12886,27,"by underplaying truman , he allows the subtle manipulations of the film to take over .",pos

3,cv370,5221,33,"now , i could go off on the mpaa's ruling that a trailer must contain "" no homosexuality or lesbianism "" and ask how that is defined , particularly in light of some of the things , both sexual and non-sexual , that i've watched straight people do in trailers .",pos

3,cv371,7630,4,"in its many incarnations--graphic novels ( "" manga "" ) , two different runs of made-for-video episodes ( original animation videos , or oavs for short ) , and a television series running to nearly fifty episodes--patlabor has proven to be one of the most popular series ever in japan .",pos
3,cv371,7630,5,"set in the very near future ( though it was a somewhat farther away near future when the series was first conceived ) , this atypical giant robot anime features the characters , rather than the machinery , as the primary focus .",pos
3,cv371,7630,6,"as a whole , patlabor is the story of an exciting time for japan .",pos
3,cv371,7630,7,"as the prologue to each episode of the television series explains , giant industrial robots , known as "" labors "" ( an interesting play on words , considering that "" robot "" is derived from the czech word for labor ) , have come into widespread use in japan toward the close of the twentieth century .",pos
3,cv371,7630,8,"with the rise of labors , however , has come a new menace--labor crime .",pos
3,cv371,7630,9,"this led to the creation of the two special vehicle divisions , using patrol labors to fight labor crime .",pos
3,cv371,7630,10,"the patlabor story centers around the second special vehicle division , sv2 , who , through no fault of their own , have acquired a bad reputation for destructiveness .",pos
3,cv371,7630,11,"sometimes utterly hilarious , sometimes almost deadly serious , the patlabor series explores the interpersonal relationships of the special vehicle crewmembers , and also looks at the effects of technology on modern life .",pos
3,cv371,7630,12,"those who are unfamiliar with the patlabor story and characters may find themselves slightly confused coming into the movie , although there is ample background exposition provided for new viewers .",pos
3,cv371,7630,13,"the story , as has much of patlabor before , centers around the controversial babylon project , a gigantic seawall that will , on its completion , allow the reclamation of thousands of square miles of land from tokyo bay .",pos
3,cv371,7630,14,"this project has been an almost constant target of environmentalist terrorists , most notably the house of sea organization .",pos
3,cv371,7630,15,"however , the threat in this case comes not from any terrorist , but from someone who is already dead . . .",pos
3,cv371,7630,16,"shinohara heavy industries , the premier labor manufacturer in japan ( if not the whole world ) , has just come out with a new operating system that increases labors' movement speed and efficiency by 30% .",pos

3,cv371,7630,18,"since that installation , dozens of labors , including a heavily-armed military model , have begun to go on berzerk rampages for no apparent reason . . . and the only factor they all had in common was that they were all running under the new hos .",pos

3,cv371,7630,21,"as was the case with _ghost in the shell_ , if you just want a no-brainer actionfest , this might not be the movie for you .",pos
3,cv371,7630,22,"_patlabor : the movie_ is more of a psychological thriller , a technological suspense drama .",pos
3,cv371,7630,23,"it is closer , perhaps , to a chrichton novel than to an action movie ( crichton novels that have been made _into_ action movies notwithstanding ) .",pos
3,cv371,7630,24,"there are long , thoughtful montages of dialogueless footage as two investigators make their way through slums and derelict housing in old quarters of tokyo , similar to sequences from _ghost in the shell_ .",pos
3,cv371,7630,25,this movie is fraught with symbolism--in fact a large part of it is based on christian symbolism .,pos
3,cv371,7630,26,"patlabor's near-future setting is , aside from the giant robots tromping around , very similar to our own present day .",pos
3,cv371,7630,27,the film uses this setting to make its central point : is progress moving too fast for humans to keep up ?,pos
3,cv371,7630,28,are history and culture falling by the wayside like the old buildings that are being torn down and replaced with new ?,pos
3,cv371,7630,29,this is a question just as applicable to today as it is to patlabor's alternate-1999 setting .,pos

3,cv371,7630,32,"the oavs and tv series were more cheerful , better-suited to humor ; the movie , however , makes everyone look a great deal less cute , and emphasizes that this is going to be , for the most part , a deadly serious storyline .",pos
3,cv371,7630,33,"as far as cinematography goes , there are many interesting moments in _patlabor : the movie_ .",pos
3,cv371,7630,34,"i don't think i can recall ever seeing a fish-eye perspective used in any other animated film ( save for _ghost in the shell_ , another oshii film ) , or indeed , in many other movies at all .",pos
3,cv371,7630,35,"the cinematography is well-suited to the storyline , emphasizing what it needs to , though a couple of scenes ( where characters' features are exaggerated in anger ) may seem slightly strange to western audiences .",pos
3,cv371,7630,36,"the audio track of _patlabor : the movie_ is in glorious hi-fi stereo , and should be used to demonstrate home theater systems--it _is_ that good .",pos

3,cv371,7630,41,"large enough that they don't strain the eyes , but small enough not to conceal too much of the screen .",pos
3,cv371,7630,42,"although it does have several action sequences in it , most notably the climactic conclusion , _patlabor_ is foremost not an action movie .",pos
3,cv371,7630,43,"although it is a superbly-realized film , it relies in large part upon prior familiarity with some of the characters to carry the story , and that could detract from some people's enjoyment .",pos

3,cv373,20404,4,"liman , who also photographed the film , has a deft touch with the camera , and the film looks good .",pos
3,cv373,20404,5,"the film also seems to have benefited from a budget , with the night-club scenes in particular looking pretty good .",pos
3,cv373,20404,6,there's a twisted sense of humour running throughout which ensures that even the darkest scenes get a smirk .,pos

3,cv373,20404,8,"holmes , one of the dawson's creek cast ( a show i'm not particularly fond of ) displays much talent here , and despite her largely limited screen time manages to make a three dimensional character and never becomes a caricature .",pos
3,cv373,20404,9,"askew is slightly successful , being rather obnoxious .",pos
3,cv373,20404,10,"no doubt the filmmakers intended this to make the audience cheer when what happens to him , but instead of 'funny annoying' he's just annoying .",pos

3,cv373,20404,12,the real standout is sarah polley as the drug dealing checkout girl : her refreshing and deeply enjoyable performance makes the heavy going stories she is involved in much more entertaining .,pos
3,cv373,20404,13,"also entertaining timothy olyphant as the rather sinister drug dealer , who gives an nice evil performance .",pos
3,cv373,20404,14,"the script , written john august , is sharp and witty , with good dialogue and some funny jokes .",pos
3,cv373,20404,15,"it starts off rather slow however , but in about twenty minutes the script has found it's footing and just keeps getting better .",pos
3,cv373,20404,16,"the stories are largely satisfying , although occasionally there's too much attention on one detail but not on another .",pos
3,cv373,20404,17,"also , some of the endings seem a little forced and lucky .",pos
3,cv373,20404,18,"still , the cast have a meaty script to get into and obviously enjoy it .",pos
3,cv373,20404,19,"it could of tried a little harder in some parts however , and these parts lag .",pos
3,cv373,20404,20,"because this is a gen-xer movie , the obligatory rave soundtrack must accompany , and go's one is pretty decent .",pos
3,cv373,20404,21,"unlike other gen-xers movies , go never allows the music to substitute for plot or dialogue , which is a plus .",pos
3,cv373,20404,22,"go is a very easy movie to absorb into , and the audience really starts feeling for these characters .",pos
3,cv373,20404,23,"thankfully , they never become two dimensional characters who are bent and twisted throughout the movie to fit into the stories mechanics ( like the heroine in 10 things i hate about you . )",pos
3,cv373,20404,24,they are who they are and they stay that way .,pos

3,cv374,25436,5,is a very funny movie .,pos
3,cv374,25436,6,"the plot ( which the film wisely doesn't linger on the specifics of for too long ) is of course nothing more than framework for the jokes , most of which work very well .",pos
3,cv374,25436,7,"the material may be considered crude and tasteless by many , and i might have thought so as well had shandling not been the lead .",pos
3,cv374,25436,8,"but he brings a sort of pathetic charm to the role , and it's his performance that makes the film truly funny instead of just offensive .",pos
3,cv374,25436,9,"plus if you think about it , what planet are you from ?",pos
3,cv374,25436,10,could have very easily gone the gross-out route ( considering that shandling's character is given a detachable penis that vibrates and hums when he gets excited ) .,pos
3,cv374,25436,11,"we never see anything though , it's all implied , which gives the film a touch of class amidst its crudeness .",pos
3,cv374,25436,12,"i'm glad to see that someone in hollywood still understands the concept of "" less is more "" .",pos
3,cv374,25436,13,the talented supporting cast certainly adds to one's enjoyment of this film .,pos

3,cv374,25436,15,does a fine job keeping up with shandling and makes a good catalyst for his brand of humor .,pos

3,cv376,19435,1,it was a period that would mercilessly force me to exit boyhood and thrust me into the unwelcome arms of adulthood .,pos
3,cv376,19435,2,"but of all the experiences that i collected throughout those tender years , i can honestly say that the toughest and the scariest thing that i had to cope with was my raging hormones and my crazed curiosity about girls and sex .",pos
3,cv376,19435,3,"yes , more scarier than my seventh grade english teacher and even scarier than the bullies that constantly hounded me , trying to deal with my personal wonderment about sex was like trying to fight an invisible monster .",pos

3,cv376,19435,23,the one thing that i want to say about this film is that it well deserves its `r' rating .,pos
3,cv376,19435,24,there is stuff in here that is completely gross in the same manner that `there's something about mary' was gloriously ribald .,pos
3,cv376,19435,25,"in fact , at first this film received a sinful nc-17 rating before a couple of more cuts finally brought it down to a teen-accessible rating .",pos
3,cv376,19435,26,"but i guess after seeing the no-holds-barred coarseness of south park , this seems tame by comparison .",pos
3,cv376,19435,27,teens and anyone who can still remember their acne years are the ones that will laugh hardest .,pos
3,cv376,19435,28,"but unlike many teen sex comedies , there is a genuine intelligence at work here .",pos

3,cv377,7946,0,"full metal jacket , very much like every other hard-hitting film about the vietnam war , is an shocking , emotional depiction of the war that effected almost everyone in america .",pos
3,cv377,7946,1,"this film is more like platoon than any other in the way that it chronicles the struggles of a young man ( private joker , played by matthew modine ) during his tour in the vietnam war .",pos
3,cv377,7946,2,"however , full metal jacket gives the audience an insight into combat life very rarely seen before : boot camp .",pos
3,cv377,7946,3,"these sequences are considered to be the best part in this three act film , even though i found the later portions to be equally stunning .",pos
3,cv377,7946,4,"as in platoon , full metal jacket gets off to a quick start .",pos
3,cv377,7946,5,"the opening sequence is the initiation for the recruits , which is getting their heads shaved .",pos
3,cv377,7946,6,"from there , they find themselves standing at attention and receiving their orders from the extremely hard and punishing sergeant hartman , played extremely well by the former drill instructor r . lee ermey .",pos
3,cv377,7946,7,"apparently , the solution was found for the perfect man to play a drill instructor in the movies , because ermey depicts his character extremely well and will make you thank whomever that you were never subjected to such horrible situations .",pos

3,cv377,7946,25,"again , as in the tradition of vietnam war films , full metal jacket can be debated as to whether it is an anti-war film or not .",pos
3,cv377,7946,26,a few of the more powerful scenes toward the end will leave you to decide .,pos
3,cv377,7946,27,"full metal jacket succeeds extremely well in documenting the life of a young man in vietnam , as have others in the past .",pos
3,cv377,7946,28,"this film , in different ways , also can be viewed as more powerful than others .",pos
3,cv377,7946,29,"that , again , is up for debate and depends on your opinion .",pos
3,cv377,7946,30,"one thing is for sure , however ; no one ever wants to experience the absolute hell that these soldiers are subjected to .",pos

3,cv378,20629,7,stone doesn't in any way apologize for nixon .,pos
3,cv378,20629,8,"he blames not only nixon's own character flaws but also the imperial presidency itself , the system that , once set in motion , behaves with a mindlessness of its own .",pos
3,cv378,20629,9,""" nixon "" is a modern shakespeare story - a saga about a ruler destroyed by his fatal flaws .",pos
3,cv378,20629,10,"there's something almost majestic about the process : as nixon goes down in this film , there is no gloating , but a watery sigh , as of a great ship sinking .",pos

3,cv378,20629,19,"the flashy editing by brian berdan and frank corwin , robert richardson's rich cinematography and john williams' musical score create a hectic and bizarre atmosphere .",pos

3,cv379,21963,0,"in tim burton's `sleepy hollow' , there is a mysterious headless horseman who decapitates residents of the small town of the same name .",pos

3,cv379,21963,2,"burton's update on washington irving's classic tale of `the legend of sleepy hollow' offers us the mystery of the horseman , when the screenplay should have merely settled on the aspect of the horror .",pos
3,cv379,21963,3,"writer andrew kevin walker ( `seven' ) throws in perhaps too healthy a dosage of sherlock holmes , but the visual treatment of the film is absolutely entrancing , as burton offers foggy locales and detailed costumes that are gorgeous and stirring to examine .",pos
3,cv379,21963,4,"as `sleepy hollow' opens , we're greeted with a juicy cameo from martin landau , who won an oscar in burton's `ed wood' .",pos
3,cv379,21963,5,"landau plays a prominent citizen of sleepy hollow , who , on a fateful carriage ride through the forest , is decapitated by an unseen horseback rider .",pos

3,cv379,21963,7,"landlord baltus von tassel ( michael gambon ) explains to crane that the heads have been severed from the carcass and mysteriously taken in each separate case , and that they believe the murderer is a dead hessian trooper ( played briefly by a wonderfully jarring christopher walken ) who has risen from the grave after being decapitated in the western woods .",pos
3,cv379,21963,8,"crane is not a man of great superstition , and is determined to root out the human culprit with his assortment of gizmos and gadgets ( things i was not surprised to find in a tim burton movie ) .",pos
3,cv379,21963,9,"first and foremost , `sleepy hollow' is a fun horror film .",pos
3,cv379,21963,10,"as with virtually all burton movies , we are treated to a wonderful score by composer danny elfman , who has once again poured excitement and imagination into an atmospheric soundtrack that accentuates the gothic mood perfectly .",pos
3,cv379,21963,11,"the horseman f/x are stylish and impressive , particularly in perfectly blended battle sequences involving actual actors .",pos
3,cv379,21963,12,but why did i enjoy `sleepy hollow' as much as i did ?,pos
3,cv379,21963,13,"although enjoyable , it was not the numerous beheadings and the plentiful gore that spurted left and right . .",pos
3,cv379,21963,14,it was the light comic touch that burton applied .,pos
3,cv379,21963,15,"the film has the sweetness of a candy apple , usually channeled through depp's wonderful performance as the lovable geek ichabod crane , who is no longer a mild-mannered school teacher but still attains his cowardly qualities .",pos
3,cv379,21963,16,this is certainly not the only alteration that's been made .,pos
3,cv379,21963,17,"as the film progresses , it becomes apparent that walker is more concerned with the mystery of the murders than the murders themselves .",pos
3,cv379,21963,18,"the momentum is slowed considerably once crane begins piecing the mystery together , because for the audience , it's not an issue we particularly wish to be solved .",pos
3,cv379,21963,19,it's more effective for the headless horseman to be an elusive demon than an elusive demon with an ulterior motive .,pos
3,cv379,21963,20,"still , we are still captivated by the breathtaking technical detail and burton's keen eye to capture our attention .",pos
3,cv379,21963,21,"the costuming is exceptional , and the dialogue is crisp and effective throughout ( it's recognizable that the script was refined by award-winning playwright tom stoppard ) .",pos
3,cv379,21963,22,the supporting cast exhibits more color and playfulness than many .,pos

3,cv380,7574,6,"in addition to the above , it is typical of a lot of recent movies in that it is really just a glorified made-for-tv movie , but longer and with bigger stars , and you have to pay to see it .",pos

3,cv381,20172,22,this is the actor's finest work since his breakthrough into the hollywood market in the early 80's .,pos
3,cv381,20172,23,"murphy excels at every corner , not only succeeding with presenting believable paranoia in the eyes of kit ramsey , but in creating a likable buffoon in jiff as well .",pos

3,cv382,7897,2,"as if reservoir dogs wasn't perfect , tarantino went ahead and improved on perfection by creating pulp fiction , a fast-paced , hard talking , roller coaster ride of a movie that combines violence and extraordinary dialogue in a seemingly perfect way .",pos
3,cv382,7897,3,every major character in this film is represented by a terrific acting performance by the actor .,pos

3,cv382,7897,10,"the film interweaves three stories that , at first , seem to be nothing alike but later prove to be very critical to each other .",pos
3,cv382,7897,11,the film begins with pumpkin and honey bunny in a small coffee shop discussing their recent robberies and hold-ups .,pos
3,cv382,7897,12,"the two quickly decide to hold up the coffee shop , unknowing of what lies ahead .",pos
3,cv382,7897,13,"after this , the film focuses for some time on vincent and jules and their hit man lifestyle .",pos

3,cv382,7897,29,"along with its superb dialogue , action , writing , directing , and acting , this film will not only latch onto you , but it proves that it does not want to release you until it has sunk its claws completely into you .",pos
3,cv382,7897,30,"and with most fans of this movie , this is proved to be a rather easy task , although at times the graphic images , violence , and language may seem a bit overpowering .",pos

3,cv383,13116,0,i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x-files .,pos
3,cv383,13116,1,"first , let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie .",pos
3,cv383,13116,2,"the producers are not stupid , making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable .",pos
3,cv383,13116,3,you have to reach for a larger audience .,pos
3,cv383,13116,4,"therefore , the movie is quite user-friendly .",pos
3,cv383,13116,5,"altough , non-fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange .",pos
3,cv383,13116,6,"but fear not , duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on .",pos
3,cv383,13116,7,you will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera .,pos
3,cv383,13116,8,"in any case , the answer is no .",pos
3,cv383,13116,9,"i am not a fan of the x-files , i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium .",pos
3,cv383,13116,10,"however , since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie's opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie .",pos
3,cv383,13116,11,"i taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie , i am glad to report that i learned nothing new .",pos
3,cv383,13116,12,everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others .,pos
3,cv383,13116,13,i know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie .,pos
3,cv383,13116,14,warning : major spoilers follow !,pos
3,cv383,13116,15,"please do not read , to fully enjoy this movie you must not be able know what is coming , what exactly is over that hill and what that weird "" hummm "" sound is all about .",pos
3,cv383,13116,16,you have been warned .,pos
3,cv383,13116,17,the x-files is what a summer should be .,pos
3,cv383,13116,18,"exciting , scary , great special effects ( unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary ) and good performances .",pos
3,cv383,13116,19,this is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank .,pos
3,cv383,13116,20,"from start to finish , this movie does not let go of you .",pos
3,cv383,13116,21,when i compare it with last summer's movies the best way to describe it would be : take the excitement and great score from face/off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon .,pos
3,cv383,13116,22,"this flick is scary , not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes .",pos
3,cv383,13116,23,"in fact , the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue .",pos
3,cv383,13116,24,you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd !,pos
3,cv383,13116,25,the last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid .,pos

3,cv383,13116,28,and guess what ?,pos
3,cv383,13116,29,"you never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed , computer generated , babyzilla , it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster .",pos
3,cv383,13116,30,do not think that the x-files is a monster movie .,pos
3,cv383,13116,31,"in fact , the creature is there for maybe three minutes total .",pos
3,cv383,13116,32,"no , the x-files is definately a mulder episode of the series .",pos

3,cv383,13116,39,cares ! ?,pos
3,cv383,13116,40,if he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about ?,pos
3,cv383,13116,41,the dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous .,pos
3,cv383,13116,42,the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill .,pos

3,cv383,13116,48,the person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation .,pos

3,cv383,13116,50,") the x-files does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots , every scene is crucial and serves a purpose .",pos

3,cv383,13116,60,"it does not provide answers to the show's many questions , the status quo remains nearly the same and , no , mulder and scully do not get together .",pos

3,cv383,13116,65,"it's pretty obvious the film's makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time , but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving .",pos

3,cv389,9369,5,"they are , naturally enough , more than a little frightened and confused , and it doesn't help matters any when "" mystery man "" ( robert blake ) approaches fred at a party and proceeds to call himself on the telephone at the madisons' house in a scene that is at once hilarious and unnerving .",pos

3,cv389,9369,9,"i would be giving away a little too much to reveal any more , but suffice it to say that lynch doesn't offer any neat wrap ? ups , nor does he put a lid on the metaphysical confusion : the cinematic demons of "" lost highway "" are out in full force from beginning to end .",pos
3,cv389,9369,10,"this description might make "" lost highway "" sound like a giddy exercise in haywire surrealism , but in fact , while there are traces of lynch's weird sense of humor , this film is anything but giddy most of the time .",pos
3,cv389,9369,11,"on the contrary , lost highway is a dark and perplexing mystery that takes lynch's previous excursions into murder and intrigue one step farther .",pos
3,cv389,9369,12,"the film does not revolve around a character investigating a mystery ; rather , the character * is * the mystery .",pos
3,cv389,9369,13,"there are recurring and at times deeply disturbing images of suspicion , distrust , and infidelity thoughout the film that seem to indicate a deluded , fractured psyche at the root of all the bizarre goings-on here .",pos
3,cv389,9369,14,"we , the audience , are left to puzzle out whose psyche it is that is driving this ( probably fred's , in my opinion ) and what , in that case , the other characters and events are meant to represent .",pos
3,cv389,9369,15,"all of this proceeds , appropriately , in lynch's typically slow-paced , idiosyncratic style .",pos
3,cv389,9369,16,"as is often the case , lynch relies on sound , imagery , and mood more than on dialogue and action to tell his story , and in "" lost highway "" it works perfectly .",pos
3,cv389,9369,17,"there are scenes when the camera lingers on fred's blank expression as he drifts uncomfortably down a hallway , or on his pained face in his prison cell while the haunting strains of this mortal coil's "" song to the siren "" can be heard faintly in the background ; nothing is technically "" happening "" in these scenes , yet they present a vivid picture of a man losing his grip just as effective as , if not more so than , the hysterical screaming found in most movie presentations of insanity .",pos
3,cv389,9369,18,lynch's direction and director of photography pete deming's darkly lit cinematography serve to create a nearly suffocating atmosphere of tension and fear that are exactly what is needed for this story .,pos
3,cv389,9369,19,"well , most of the time , anyway - i have to admit that i was a bit bored at times during the section of the film with pete dayton as the protgaonist , which is less inherently interesting and mostly keeps the viewer's attention because of its tie-ins to the original mystery .",pos
3,cv389,9369,20,"the main characters in this "" reality "" - dayton ( a well-meaning but none too intelligent 24-year-old ) , a sleazy gangster ( who for some reason has two names but otherwise is pretty much a stock character ) , and his porn-star girlfriend ( the blond arquette ) - are nothing you couldn't find in any of the two dozen "" pulp fiction "" wannabes ; fortunately , the reappearance of the mystery man as well as some other typically lynchian elements , such as the strained , awkward conversations between pete and his parents , help to preserve the film's spooky , unnerving tone during this stretch .",pos
3,cv389,9369,21,"lynch's typically graphic and disturbing portrayals of fringe sexuality , while relevant to the themes of jealousy and adultery , are also somewhat overdone here .",pos
3,cv389,9369,22,"it's not exactly exploitative - like almost everything else in this film , the sex is thoroughly weird and creepy and is unlikely to provide any cheap lurid thrills - as much as it is unnecessary and frankly kind of dumb by the seventh or eighth time arquette takes her clothes off .",pos

3,cv391,10802,36,"but still , they coulda cut it down a bit .",pos
3,cv391,10802,37,"but the film is saved with its presentation , as well as some other elements .",pos
3,cv391,10802,38,"the atmosphere is very dark and forboding , creating a kind of cool weird feeling .",pos
3,cv391,10802,39,and there are several scenes are just amazing .,pos
3,cv391,10802,40,"one scene has catherine and james having sex , while she softly asks him questions about being with a man , which sounds almost erotic the way she says it .",pos
3,cv391,10802,41,a sequence involving one character's death is filled with all the edgy disjointment that the film needs .,pos
3,cv391,10802,42,"and the final shot is shot perfectly , creating an image of a car crash , and a couple having sex in front of it , despite the fact that she's wounded .",pos
3,cv391,10802,43,"the acting is also pretty good , especially for what is almost a porn ( ousting linda lovelace as best actress in a porn ) .",pos

3,cv391,10802,52,"kosteas is a little known actor ( his biggest role was casey jones in "" teenage mutant ninja turtles "" ) , but here he shows a deniro-like presence , hinting that he's capable of bigger roles .",pos
3,cv391,10802,53,"while i hardly enjoyed "" crash , "" it's still a pretty intriguing portrayal of a group of people who , if the exist , are some of the strangest and most bizarre people in the world .",pos
3,cv391,10802,54,"these people are able to share a rush between two completely different entities , and the film , which doesn't exactly pain them in a negative light , is sucessful in bringing them to light , even if it leaves the viewer unnerved and generally freaked out .",pos
3,cv391,10802,55,"despite the hardcore nature of the film and the subsequent nc-17 rating ( there's also an r-rated version , but i wouldn't even go near that thing ) , anyone looking for a quick turn-on should just rent a regular porno .",pos

3,cv398,15537,24,hamlet also seems to be a film in which someone tried to stuff as many well known actors as possible .,pos

3,cv398,15537,30,"part of his monologue is overlaid with a visual enactment of the story ( with sir john gielgud and judi dench ) , but this is most unfortunate , for it robs heston of some of the attention which he deserves at this time .",pos
3,cv398,15537,31,"his off-camera speaking , while gripping , sort of downplays the scene to a narration done by any other well-voiced actor .",pos

3,cv398,15537,42,hamlet is a complicated tale of treachery and revenge in which triumph and defeat become one .,pos
3,cv398,15537,43,branagh attempts to help us out with some of the intricacies by visually representing some of the more elusive stretches of dialogue by presenting them as flashback-type images .,pos

4,cv401,12605,22,"also impressive are dicaprio and winslet , who wholly succeed in rising above the often poor dialogue , and the bond they form is both heartfelt and moving .",pos
4,cv401,12605,23,"it's an old story , you know -- forbidden love ala romeo and juliet -- but it works , and jack's "" rescuing "" rose ( in both literal and figurative senses ) and teaching her to live life for what counts was pointed and touching .",pos

4,cv401,12605,44,"the bit where rose lets go of jack's hand , while promising she'll never let go in her heart was particularly heart-wrenching , and the sight of rescue boats sailing amid the ocean of corpses was a pretty powerful image , to put no fine a point on it .",pos
4,cv401,12605,45,"i loved the ending , however , which was both moving and slightly uplifting following the horror of the past hour and a half .",pos
4,cv401,12605,46,"so , we've established that the film is powerful and moving , if the last hour was rather excessive .",pos
4,cv401,12605,47,haven't mentioned the script .,pos
4,cv401,12605,48,"plot-wise it's ok , though the jack/rose relationship was beautifully developed , but i've a feeling that's to the actors credit if anything .",pos
4,cv401,12605,49,"as for the dialogue ? well , titanic is set in 1912 .",pos
4,cv401,12605,50,it's a period drama .,pos
4,cv401,12605,51,but i saw very little indication of period in so far as the dialogue is concerned .,pos
4,cv401,12605,52,"did they really use phrases like "" goddamn it ! """,pos
4,cv401,12605,53,back in the turn of the century ?,pos
4,cv401,12605,54,i doubt it .,pos
4,cv401,12605,55,"would someone talk like this : "" do ya love the guy or what ? "" .",pos
4,cv401,12605,56,i doubt it .,pos
4,cv401,12605,57,"is such dialogue as "" i saw the iceberg , and i see it in your eyes now "" not just a bit ? clumsy ?",pos
4,cv401,12605,58,yes it is .,pos
4,cv401,12605,59,"a little more attention to dialogue would not have gone astray , and cameron himself is to blame ( he wrote the script ) .",pos
4,cv401,12605,60,"stick with directing , dude .",pos
4,cv401,12605,61,"but its more than redeemed by the acting , with dicaprio and winslet on fine form , ably supported by a strong cast .",pos
4,cv401,12605,62,"star of the show was gloria stuart , though -- why didn't she win that oscar ? !",pos
4,cv401,12605,63,"after all , they were throwing oscars at "" titanic "" left , right and centre , but gloria was perhaps the most deserving nominee .",pos
4,cv401,12605,64,directing-wise cameron does a spectacular job .,pos
4,cv401,12605,65,"like i said , his vision was a bit excessive , but at least he directed it well .",pos
4,cv401,12605,66,i haven't even mentioned james horner's beautiful score .,pos
4,cv401,12605,67,"utterly heavenly , though when your dad and sister play the soundtrack a lot you do start to get a bit bored with it !",pos

4,cv401,12605,69,"i've finished my rant , which lasted a lot longer than i thought it would !",pos

4,cv401,12605,71,"hell , don't talk to me about oscars .",pos
4,cv401,12605,72,bloomin' farce .,pos
4,cv401,12605,73,"it was deserving in a number of departments , though .",pos
4,cv401,12605,74,"last question ; is it , as some suggest , one of the best films of all-time ?",pos
4,cv401,12605,75,"nope , i don't think so .",pos
4,cv401,12605,76,"it's certainly one of the most powerful and memorable films i've ever seen , but i don't think it quite ranks as one of my all-time favourites .",pos
4,cv401,12605,77,"and as for the fact they're reportedly making a "" titanic 2 "" ? well i guess that's typical hollywood for you !",pos

4,cv402,14425,6,"however , that doesn't necessarily make for a bad film .",pos
4,cv402,14425,7,rush hour is jackie chan's first major hollywood film since the dismal the protector ( 1985 ) .,pos
4,cv402,14425,8,"proving once again that hollywood can learn many things from foreign film markets ( ie : hong kong ) , jackie chan is given much more free reign than before .",pos
4,cv402,14425,9,"still , some die-hard jackie chan fans may be disappointed , as even chan himself has voiced displeasure over the length of the fight scenes ( which he views as too short , according to one interview ) .",pos
4,cv402,14425,10,this film takes a familiar theme of east meets west .,pos
4,cv402,14425,11,"jackie chan is lee , the straight laced inspector who is imported to help deal with a kidnapping case , while chris tucker is carter , the loudmouthed , destructive cop that is `promoted' to the fbi to help him .",pos
4,cv402,14425,12,"or , at least , so he thinks ( also another classic notion in action films : the fbi must always get in the way of our heroes ) .",pos
4,cv402,14425,13,"despite the necessary conventions of action films , rush hour is some of the most fun you'll spend and hour and forty minutes watching .",pos
4,cv402,14425,14,"jackie chan continues to be one of the most exciting martial artists on the big screen , continuing to perform his own stunts and dazzling audiences with his flashy kicks and punches .",pos
4,cv402,14425,15,"chris tucker , familiar from his whiny , annoying role in the fifth element is more palatable , complementing jackie chan's straight-laced character .",pos
4,cv402,14425,16,"however , jackie chan still maintains his comic-slapstick edge , as expected of him and his films .",pos
4,cv402,14425,17,"perfectly downplaying the `fish-out-of-water' routine through his character's attempts at mixing into american culture , he makes up for the down time his character experiences .",pos
4,cv402,14425,18,"when he is in action , however , you'll be amused and dazzled .",pos
4,cv402,14425,19,"still being inventive in the use of objects to beat people up ( in this case , a steering wheel , a serving tray , and a barstool ) , jackie chan proves to be the pioneer of slapstick kung fu .",pos
4,cv402,14425,20,"chris tucker's character may come across as irritating , yet is also humorous .",pos
4,cv402,14425,21,"since he's not a physical actor to the level of jackie chan , he uses his main weapon : his mouth ( hence , the tagline , `fastest hands in the east meets the fastest mouth in the west' ) .",pos
4,cv402,14425,22,"while dialogue is not necessarily shakespeare , it is appropriate for the film and still very funny .",pos
4,cv402,14425,23,"while not necessarily poignant , attempts at character development and growth between characters come off surprisingly well .",pos
4,cv402,14425,24,lee's `knowledge' of american pop culture ( `that's the beach boys ! ' ),pos
4,cv402,14425,25,"when contrasted against carter's lack of knowledge of chinese culture makes for an interesting scene where lee teaches carter the kung fu disarming trick , while carter teaches lee hip-hop dance moves .",pos
4,cv402,14425,26,"while rush hour is not at the same level as police story 3 and 4 ( known in north america as supercop and jackie chan's first strike , respectively ) , it more than makes up for the poorly received films operation condor and mr . nice guy .",pos
4,cv402,14425,27,"with its appropriate mixture of high kicks and lots of laughs , it makes for a fun film .",pos
4,cv402,14425,28,"as well , it is a true departure from jackie chan films , as it is missing one common element : a whiny female co-star .",pos
4,cv403,6621,0,"my fellow americans is a movie that at first glance looks to have little substance ( or a movie that we've all seen a million times ) , two lifetime rivals thrown together and then the fun begins .",pos
4,cv403,6621,1,"this is exactly what happened in this movie , but fortunately , they managed to do it in an interesting and funny way .",pos

4,cv403,6621,5,he finds a scapegoat in kramer and now everyone wants kramer and douglas dead .,pos
4,cv403,6621,6,this movie was exceptional for many reasons .,pos
4,cv403,6621,7,one being that they found people ( lemmon and garner ) that have good chemisty together .,pos
4,cv403,6621,8,"they worked very well as a unit and they mirrored each other perfectly , one being a ladies man and one being the old man ( i'll let you fiqure which is which ) .",pos
4,cv403,6621,9,"also , they found people that know their parts as govenment officials well .",pos
4,cv403,6621,10,it seemed to me that garner played almost exactly the same role that he played in the distinquished gentleman ( except then he was a congressman ) .,pos

4,cv404,20315,0,"in , "" the muse "" albert brooks plays steven phillips , a hollywood screenwriter who after winning a humanitarian award for his work is dumped by his studio .",pos

4,cv404,20315,12,the only question for steven is if the muse is worth all the trouble he's going through for her .,pos

4,cv404,20315,14,""" the muse "" is albert brooks' sixth film as writer/director/actor ( he co-wrote with monica johnson ) and although it's a good movie it's not up to the level of his best works ( "" defending your life "" and "" mother "" ) .",pos
4,cv404,20315,15,"the problem lies in the script , and for a movie that relies on its dialogue for its humor , there aren't nearly as many laughs as they are chuckles despite a few good one-liners .",pos
4,cv404,20315,16,it has a great premise but doesn't deliver up to it's full potential .,pos
4,cv404,20315,17,"but , i like albert brooks in this film and i think that we can all identify with steven phillips a little bit .",pos
4,cv404,20315,18,"he may whine and complain , but he just wants to support his family and be happy .",pos

4,cv405,20399,3,critique : a fun football movie .,pos
4,cv405,20399,4,"this film was obviously geared towards the teen market , with mtv behind its production , a big tv star actor in the lead role , rockin' hip music galore , and plenty of t&a .",pos
4,cv405,20399,5,"having said that , i enjoyed the look and feel of the movie , thought james van der beek gave a solid performance , loved the slick sounds , and yup , loved that t&a !",pos
4,cv405,20399,6,"i actually thought this was a comedy going in , but overall , it plays more towards the dramatic , than a comedy .",pos
4,cv405,20399,7,"i also enjoyed jon voight's performance as the stubborn dick coach , as well as many of the other character players on the team .",pos
4,cv405,20399,8,"this is not a classic film by any stretch of the imagination , but it might teach some kids the hard lessons behind the "" fun "" game of football , or just allow them to have a good time for about an hour and forty-five minutes in the movie theatre ( or in the comfort of their own home , depending on where you watch this stuff . )",pos
4,cv405,20399,9,"all in all , i would definitely watch this movie if you like football , play football or want your kid to succeed in high school football .",pos

4,cv406,21020,0,"the film starts out with a creepy opening sequence to which has the now classic and creepy score by writer/director/producer john carpenter who in my mind is a brilliant director , he really is .",pos
4,cv406,21020,1,"he wrote this film , he directed this film , he produced this film and he made the excessively creepy score to this film .",pos
4,cv406,21020,2,i think he is and always will be famous for this classic which after 21 years has not lost it's popularity or it's ability to scare the wits out of people .,pos

4,cv406,21020,26,watch it again !,pos
4,cv406,21020,27,"reviewed by brandon herring october 7 , 1999 .",pos
4,cv407,22637,0,i have to admit that i disliked this film initially .,pos
4,cv407,22637,1,"it certianly isn't for every taste , and it's sheer torture to sit through if you're in a restless mood .",pos
4,cv407,22637,2,"that said , if you are in the right mood , it's absolutely incredible .",pos
4,cv407,22637,3,"this was my second favorite movie of 1998 , and would have been a shoo-in for first in almost any other year .",pos
4,cv407,22637,4,perhaps the big turn-off for many was this film's unconventionality .,pos
4,cv407,22637,5,"i'd be hard-pressed to compare it to any other film that i've seen - it is very , very artsy , incredibly slow - and amazingly , it works beautifully .",pos
4,cv407,22637,6,"on my second viewing , i realized that the film follows the three act structure ( i didn't think it had any sort of structure at all when i first saw it ) .",pos
4,cv407,22637,7,the first act serves to set up the characters - sort of .,pos
4,cv407,22637,8,"it exists even moreso to set a mood of tension and restlesness , and perhaps even feelings of boredom .",pos
4,cv407,22637,9,and then it is shattered by the intense violence of the second ( which encompasses most of the movie ) .,pos
4,cv407,22637,10,"the majority of the film is one extended battle scene , intercut with brief flashbacks and voice-overs .",pos
4,cv407,22637,11,"the artsier elements do not detract from the action , but add to it - they succeed in briefly letting the viewer peek into the minds of the soldiers , only to be suddenly yanked back into reality when the battle resumes .",pos
4,cv407,22637,12,"the battle scenes are amazing ( second only to "" saving private ryan "" in my opinion ) .",pos
4,cv407,22637,13,"they're brutal , horrifying , and at times beautiful due to the amazing cinematography .",pos
4,cv407,22637,14,"the second act is as immersive , brilliant , and haunting as any film that i have ever seen .",pos
4,cv407,22637,15,the only problems come during the first and third acts .,pos
4,cv407,22637,16,malick takes a little too long to get the film started .,pos
4,cv407,22637,17,"although the initial scenes - which consist of two soldiers' experiencing a near-eden-like paradise while going awol , and the preperations for battle - are effective and necessary , hints of pretentiousness sink in .",pos
4,cv407,22637,18,"the film is just a tad too artsy near the beginning , and a lot of people that disliked the movie probably gave up on it because of this .",pos
4,cv407,22637,19,"the final act is effective at winding the film down , but the problems from the first persist - it's a bit too long , and comes over as pretentious at times .",pos
4,cv407,22637,20,"that said , there are two sequences ( one where a soldier gets a devastating note from his wife , and another where one of the main characters is killed ) that are nothing short of incredible .",pos
4,cv407,22637,21,the performances are phenominal all around .,pos
4,cv407,22637,22,"the two standouts are nick nolte and newcomer jim caviezel , both of whom should have been nominated for oscars .",pos
4,cv407,22637,23,nolte is riveting and intense as the colonel in charge of the operation .,pos
4,cv407,22637,24,"his character is hard , mean , and somewhat reckless with the lives of his men , and yet nolte somehow manages to evoke sympathy for him .",pos
4,cv407,22637,25,"caviezel is forever questioning the nature of war , his place in it , and if there's any deeper meaning to the hell that he's going through .",pos
4,cv407,22637,26,"he is absolutely perfect - genuine , sympathetic , sincere , and yet strong when he needs to be .",pos
4,cv407,22637,27,"although restricted to a relatively small role , sean penn is also very good as the company's pessimistic seargent .",pos
4,cv407,22637,28,"as to how it stacks up to "" saving private ryan "" - it was my second favorite movie of 1998 , "" ryan "" was my first .",pos
4,cv407,22637,29,"it's really hard to compare the two - they are so , so different - so i won't , beyond saying that spielberg's film had more of an impact on me .",pos
4,cv407,22637,30,"however , the two are comparable from the standpoint of quality ( i can easily see why someone would "" the thin red line "" above "" ryan ) .",pos
4,cv407,22637,31,"i highly recommend both of them , and consider them to be the two best war movies ever made .",pos
4,cv407,22637,32,"all in all , "" the thin red line "" is filmmaking of an incredibly high order .",pos
4,cv407,22637,33,it's slight faults are easily offset by the sheer brilliance of what is done right .,pos
4,cv407,22637,34,"it's a real shame that it tanked at the box office - films this unconventional , powerful , and thought-provoking don't come along very often .",pos
4,cv408,5297,0,it was a rainy friday afternoon in columbus when i persuaded a friend to see a matinee performance of mst3k : tm .,pos
4,cv408,5297,1,"he had never seen any episodes of the show , and i have watched a scant few , due to its unsocial airtime on comedy central and the uneven nature of many of the episodes .",pos
4,cv408,5297,2,"for those of you not familiar with the premise , dr clayton forrester ( beaulieu ) wishes to take over the world by finding the worst film ever made and unleashing it upon an unsuspecting public .",pos
4,cv408,5297,3,"to achieve this , he ( in the words of the tv series' theme , which is missing in the movie ) "" bumped [mike nelson ( nelson ) ] on the noggin and then shot him into space "" , and is monitoring nelson's reactions to the movies he is forced to endure .",pos
4,cv408,5297,4,"rather than succumb to the sheer awfulness of many of the movies , nelson spends his time making wisecracks with the help of his two robot companions , tom servo and crow t . robot .",pos
4,cv408,5297,5,"the format of the show consists of nelson , servo and crow making their comments while silhouetted against the movie being watched , and breaks every 20 minutes or so for segments set on the satellite of love , the ship on which our heroes are marooned .",pos
4,cv408,5297,6,"only two things are different in the movie : the absence of forrester's sidekick , tv's frank , and the slower pace of the jokes .",pos
4,cv408,5297,7,this latter change is presumably deliberate to avoid the viewing audience missing some of the best lines while laughing from the previous joke .,pos
4,cv408,5297,8,"for their big screen outing , the producers have chosen "" this island earth "" , a 1954 classic , and one of the first sf films to have a special effects budget larger than the average grocery bill .",pos
4,cv408,5297,9,"unfortunately for that film ( but making it ideal mst3k fodder ) , acting and dialogue appear to have taken a back seat to the effects which , by today's standards , are less than impressive .",pos
4,cv408,5297,10,"nelson & co . make jokes about everything from japan's dominance in the world market , to star trek , to the state of disrepair of seattle's kingdome , and most of them work .",pos
4,cv408,5297,11,"unfortunately , the segments set outside the satellite's movie theater seem out of place and aren't particularly funny , but at least they're fairly short .",pos
4,cv408,5297,12,the big question about this movie though is : why ?,pos
4,cv408,5297,13,"i presume it was an attempt to gain a larger following to keep support behind the series ( rumours of its impending demise circulated for some time before the plug was eventually pulled a few months ago ) , but the format gains nothing from its transition to the big screen -- there are no special effects to dazzle you , no action sequences to keep you on the edge of your seat , and no use of digital surround sound .",pos
4,cv408,5297,14,"so , it seems pointless to spend $8 per person to see this movie when in a few months it will be out on video and you can watch it for $3 , and not have to sit in a room full of popcorn addicts .",pos
4,cv408,5297,15,"nevertheless , mst3k : tm provides more laugh-out-loud opportunities than any film you're going to see this year , and i thoroughly recommend it to anyone with a pulse .",pos
4,cv408,5297,16,"given its uniqueness , i hesitate to grade it against other films , but it fulfils its claims and so in the class of "" unsubtle comedy films whose laughs come at the expense of bad b-movies "" it does well .",pos
4,cv409,29786,0,"the uncompromising nudity bared throughout petrice chereau's intimacy has already garnered much notoriety , but it's in the naked faces of fearless actors mark rylance ( angels & insects ) and kerry fox ( welcome to sarajevo ) that the tender ache of emotional resonance is discovered .",pos

4,cv411,15007,11,"and it was also unmatched for many years to come , because very few movies managed to have such a strong impact on me like george lucas' epic .",pos
4,cv411,15007,12,star wars wasn't just important movie for me ( or the millions of fans who probably share the same sentiment ) .,pos
4,cv411,15007,13,it was the defining moment in the history of modern cinema .,pos
4,cv411,15007,14,"until than , american motion picture industry was in a limbo ; social turmoil in 1960s practically destroyed the old hollywood , and new authors filled the void , mostly by using hollywood's financial and technical resources to create serious , "" personal "" or "" artsy "" movies .",pos
4,cv411,15007,15,"as a result , audience , traumatised of dark reality of vietnam and watergate , didn't want to see the same dark and serious content on the silver screen .",pos
4,cv411,15007,16,george lucas with its science fiction epic was among the first to come into rescue .,pos
4,cv411,15007,17,"the audience responded with unprecedented enthusiasm , and huge financial success of the movie , later backed by supplement industry of toys , books , comics , role playing games and other merchandise , slowly began to change the face of hollywood .",pos
4,cv411,15007,18,"serious , adult movies with artistic ambitions faded into oblivion , and were replaced by industrial products of "" blockbuster "" philosophy .",pos
4,cv411,15007,19,one of the biggest casualties of that trend was the science fiction movie genre .,pos
4,cv411,15007,20,"until 1977 , science fiction movies were mostly in b-production domain .",pos
4,cv411,15007,21,"in late 1960s , bigger budgets for science fiction didn't look so strange anymore , thanks to the great success of 2001 : a space odyssey .",pos
4,cv411,15007,22,"but the same success coincided with the surge of pesimism , and hollywood science fiction was as bleak as the rest of its production - mostly dark , dystopic movies .",pos
4,cv411,15007,23,"however , in 1977 star wars showed once and for all that this genre can be inspiration for popular movies , even among the audience that usually doesn't like it .",pos
4,cv411,15007,24,"as a result , seriousness in cinematic science fiction began fading away , although some good , dark and cult quality sf and continued to be filmed until early 1980s .",pos
4,cv411,15007,25,"after that , science fiction continued to be considered a synonym for family entertainment .",pos
4,cv411,15007,26,"ironically , the man responsible for star wars was in its time considered to be member of "" new hollywood "" generation of young movie authors who made "" artsy "" and "" personal "" films in early 1970s .",pos
4,cv411,15007,27,"george lucas established himself with the dystopic sf movie thx 1138 , and nostalgic drama american graffiti .",pos
4,cv411,15007,28,"both movies were considered "" personal "" in its time , despite latter one becoming very popular .",pos
4,cv411,15007,29,"in a sense , star wars is an also very "" personal "" film , and the thorny way to the final production shows that commercial considerations were against it , not for it .",pos

4,cv411,15007,41,"critics who don't like the movie , especially those who can't forgive lucas for his contribution to the quashing of "" new hollywood "" , are prone to point the lack of originality .",pos
4,cv411,15007,42,"on the surface , they might be right ; lucas himself admits that he found a lot of inspiration in the lore of old hollywood - westerns , wwii aviation movies , old sf cliffhanger serials of the 1930s and 1940s ; yet the most obvious element would be akira kurosawa's samurai classic the hidden fortress .",pos
4,cv411,15007,43,"on the other hand , those who had spent last two decades studying the movie to death would say that the inspiration for star wars went even further - into collective subconscious of western civilisation ( hinted by some mild tolkien references ) .",pos
4,cv411,15007,44,"the others would find the author's element within the story - star wars could be seen as an anti- establishment film ; young , long-haired , easy going , nature-loving heroes are fighting against old , uptight and oppressive forces who use supertechnology in most demonic purposes .",pos
4,cv411,15007,45,"even out of its historical or social context , star wars is an impressive as a strictly technical piece of the seven art .",pos
4,cv411,15007,46,"george lucas' direction is very good , with the clever editing and a well-paced segments between action and dramatic buildup .",pos
4,cv411,15007,47,"characters are well-drawn and deliver all the necessary ingredients , both for the space opera and hollywood blockbuster .",pos
4,cv411,15007,48,"we have a "" coming-of-age "" hero , damsel-in-distress ( somewhat toned down due to the popular feminist trends of the time ) , reluctant helper , benevolent mentor , diabolical villain and , finally , comic relief in form of two non-human characters .",pos
4,cv411,15007,49,"some of the actors are very good - alec guiness in his most famous role to date , james earl jones whose voice is enough to cause unease , peter cushing as an incarnation of pure evil in human form .",pos
4,cv411,15007,50,"unfortunately , the same can't be said for the main leads - among the main trio of mark hamill , carrie fisher and harrison ford , only the last one had the character three-dimensional enough to launch his further acting career .",pos
4,cv411,15007,51,the thing that looked like the most important segment of star wars phenomena during its initial release was the new level of special effects technology .,pos
4,cv411,15007,52,"often comparisons with 2001 : space odyssey , another ground-breaking sf film , were citing the sheer number of effects as a proof of the lucas' superiority over kubrick .",pos
4,cv411,15007,53,"however , the special effects by john dykstra and john stears are indeed impressive , even after two decades ( although 1997 special edition did improve them significantly ) , yet they aren't the most remembered trademark of the movie .",pos

4,cv412,24095,12,"i usually don't buy those cheesy "" i love you dad "" segments in movies , but this one surprisingly satisfied me .",pos
4,cv412,24095,13,maybe because the plot is so creative and universal that i believed that this is how most people would act when talking to a dead relative .,pos
4,cv412,24095,14,"frequency's creepy premise left me thinking once the film ended , what if ?",pos

4,cv412,24095,21,"both share that "" change the past slightly , and you'll change the future heavily "" warning .",pos
4,cv412,24095,22,"the changes between the present and the past , such as different newspaper headlines or people disappearing and reappearing in photographs , are very similar .",pos
4,cv412,24095,23,both are also wonderful feel-good family films that can attract to a number of generations .,pos
4,cv412,24095,24,the only difference worth noting is that frequency's final scene doesn't set up a possibility for a lucrative sequel already in the making .,pos
4,cv412,24095,25,there are some problems with the film though .,pos
4,cv412,24095,26,"first , there is a major flaw in the story towards the end that is somewhat distracting ( email me if you have seen the movie and want to know what i think it is ) .",pos
4,cv412,24095,27,the plot must have confused even the filmmakers who frequently ( no pun intended ) switch from 1969 to 1999 while telling the story .,pos
4,cv412,24095,28,"another problem is that the supporting cast , including noah emmerich and andre braugher , are underused .",pos

4,cv413,7398,2,"but no , this tacky plug comes from the poster for suspiria , perhaps italian horror director dario argento's most consistently successful film .",pos
4,cv413,7398,3,"what impresses most in re-watching this surrealistic , supernatural thriller is that argento's directorial flair and stylish visuals are matched by a near-fully coherent narrative .",pos
4,cv413,7398,4,"screenplays have always been his achilles heel ; confusing subplots , gaping holes , totally illogical incidents and reactions .",pos
4,cv413,7398,5,no question : argento has always been a better director than a writer .,pos
4,cv413,7398,6,"fortunately , he gets the plotting pretty well right with suspiria , taking his cue from a book by thomas de quincey called "" suspiria de profundis "" .",pos
4,cv413,7398,7,"the film's storyline suffers from no major lapses in logic , provided one can accept the premise of a ballet school being a front for a coven of witches .",pos

4,cv413,7398,9,"arriving at the school late at night in driving rain , she sees a girl leave and run into the storm in a clearly distressed state .",pos
4,cv413,7398,10,"what happens next - and i don't make the comparison lightly - is a murder sequence that for intensity , shock value and sheer directorial flair ranks alongside alfred hitchcock's infamous shower scene in psycho .",pos
4,cv413,7398,11,"it's quite possibly a homage to hitchcock , but with its baroque sets , graphic gore and brilliantly chaotic musical accompaniment by the gothic rock group goblin , this stunning sequence remains very much argento's own .",pos
4,cv413,7398,12,"though nothing else quite equals the intensity of suspiria's opening 15 minutes , the film continues to be never anything less than engrossing as harper begins her own investigations and slowly comes to realise this is no ordinary ballet school .",pos
4,cv413,7398,13,"we meet an assortment of slightly sinister characters , most notably the head ballet teacher played by alida valli in another one of those delicious sour-old-matriarch-from-hell roles she does so well .",pos
4,cv413,7398,14,"several more violent murders ensue , including a startling scene in a deserted square where a blind man is . . . well , i wouldn't want to spoil things now , would i ? and the film's climax , staged amid secret corridors and hidden rooms , has a gothic ghoulishness that's most impressive .",pos
4,cv413,7398,15,"the english language versions of most argento movies usually suffer trimming , and not just for the violence - deep red and phenomena , for example , have been appallingly hacked about .",pos
4,cv413,7398,16,"fortunately , the cuts to suspiria ( about 7 minutes in this version ) have not adversely affected the film .",pos
4,cv413,7398,17,"the dubbing of the italian actors into english is quite competently done , too , excepting one appalling and unintentionally hilarious effort with a conversation between harper and a professor about the history of witchcraft in the region .",pos
4,cv413,7398,18,and the soundtrack ?,pos
4,cv413,7398,19,it is interesting to imagine what power the film would have lost if it had been scored by someone else .,pos
4,cv413,7398,20,"as it stands , the use of goblin's music in suspiria is outstanding .",pos
4,cv413,7398,21,"apparently , argento played the soundtrack on location while filming so the actors could hear the music as they acted out their parts .",pos
4,cv413,7398,22,a stereo video player adds greatly to the viewer's overall experience .,pos
4,cv413,7398,23,"even better , see suspiria in a cinema , where you'll get the added bonus of widescreen .",pos
4,cv413,7398,24,and the colours !,pos
4,cv413,7398,25,"deep reds , eerie blues , a superb use of shadow and contrast .",pos
4,cv413,7398,26,"the cinematography of luciano tovoli , whose more recent credits include reversal of fortune and single white female , is uniformly superb .",pos
4,cv413,7398,27,a nod also must go to production designer giuseppe bassan for his wonderful baroque interiors .,pos
4,cv413,7398,28,"these kinds of settings are crucial to the atmosphere of argento's more surreal excursions , the other most notable example being inferno ( 1980 ) on which bassan also worked .",pos
4,cv413,7398,29,"suspiria is the film that broke dario argento into the major league of european directors , and it is fully deserving of its cult status .",pos
4,cv413,7398,30,"the gore is at times a little excessive and overstated - that's always been one of argento's shortcomings - but overall this is a fascinating , compelling example of italian horror .",pos

4,cv414,10518,1,"even though advance publicity on this one was fairly limited , the audiences waited for the showings with heightened anticipation .",pos
4,cv414,10518,2,"this is , after all , the first movie quentin tarantino has directed since the highly touted pulp fiction .",pos
4,cv414,10518,3,"to say he has been inactive in between would be to tell a falsehood , since he has been involved in such projects as destiny turns on the radio , desperado , four rooms , and from dusk 'til dawn .",pos

4,cv414,10518,6,"tarantino contributed on and off screen to these films , but never took the director's helm .",pos
4,cv414,10518,7,"nearly four years since gaining notoriety on the hollywood scene and making john travolta a star once more , tarantino returns with a film he can call his own .",pos
4,cv414,10518,8,"the film opens up with an homage to the graduate , with jackie brown ( pam grier ) on one of those airport people movers as the credits are displayed in front of her .",pos
4,cv414,10518,9,"jackie is a flight attendant for air cabo , which flies back and fourth between los angeles and cabo san lucas .",pos
4,cv414,10518,10,this makes jackie a convenient cash courier for gun dealer ordell robbi ( samuel l . jackson ) who is currently keeping his money stashed in mexico .,pos
4,cv414,10518,11,"however , while bringing fifty thousand dollars back into the u . s . for ordell , jackie is apprehended by fbi agent mark dargus ( michael bowen ) and atf agent ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , who catch her not only with the money , but with a bonus of a couple of ounces of illicit drugs .",pos

4,cv414,10518,14,"ordell uses honest bail bondsman max cherry ( robert forster ) to get jackie out of jail , but while max is immediately attracted to her , jackie is more concerned about her immediate safety , since ordell killed the last one of his operatives who got picked up by the police .",pos
4,cv414,10518,15,"sure enough , ordell shows up at jackie's apartment that evening and tries to silence jackie for good , but she "" borrows "" max's pistol and manages to turn the tables on ordell .",pos
4,cv414,10518,16,"instead of closing the irony circle and relocating a bullet from the pistol's chamber to ordell's head , jackie proposes a deal .",pos
4,cv414,10518,17,"since ordell wants to get his money out of mexico , jackie will get back up to her old tricks and be a courier for him once more , but this time for a more substantial fee : fifteen percent of ordell's half million dollars .",pos
4,cv414,10518,18,"with a gun in his face , how can ordell not agree ?",pos
4,cv414,10518,19,"by itself , this premise might have been interesting enough to carry the film .",pos
4,cv414,10518,20,"however , we are also introduced to a number of double crosses which make us pay attention and think .",pos
4,cv414,10518,21,"jackie claims to be bringing the money in for ordell , but she's also making a deal with the feds as well as with max .",pos
4,cv414,10518,22,"the film throws us off every once in a while by leading us to believe the deal we thought was authentic is actually a sham , but it is in no way done to the extent that we feel jerked around .",pos
4,cv414,10518,23,"instead , it's actually a nice departure from the predictability which is prevalent in so many of today's movies .",pos
4,cv414,10518,24,at least this film has a little imagination .,pos
4,cv414,10518,25,most of the performances in jackie brown are above par .,pos
4,cv414,10518,26,"pam grier , of whom i had never taken notice before , plays jackie with a mix of confidence and vulnerability which makes her character believable .",pos
4,cv414,10518,27,samuel l . jackson has a kind of mesmerizing quality about him as he handles himself in situations where you know he is in total control .,pos
4,cv414,10518,28,"robert forster is thoroughly likable because he comes across as such an honest guy , trying to do his best . .",pos
4,cv414,10518,29,never mind that he belongs to a profession where sneaking into a guy's apartment to zap him with a stun gun is simply a matter of course .,pos
4,cv414,10518,30,"he's just so down-to-earth , the nature of his job really doesn't occur to us , even when we're shown him bringing a handcuffed woman to prison , or when we see the tools of his trade .",pos
4,cv414,10518,31,"in supporting roles are robert de niro as louis gara , a recently paroled friend of ordell's , and bridget fonda as melanie , one of the girls ordell keeps around town .",pos
4,cv414,10518,32,"unfortunately , de niro is basically wasted as his lines are few and far between , and then they are mostly clipped sentences .",pos
4,cv414,10518,33,"in this film , he's not really de niro , but stereotypical de niro , uttering things like , "" little bit , "" and "" pretty much . """,pos
4,cv414,10518,34,"fonda , on the other hand , plays the slightly spaced-out melanie with satisfactory relish and cuteness , such that even when she is annoying louis , we are taking her side .",pos
4,cv414,10518,35,"as is characteristic of any film in which tarantino has had a hand , the dialog is quick and snappy .",pos
4,cv414,10518,36,"it grabs our attention and is actually interesting , and in many respects , this makes jackie brown a film which needs few visuals ; the lines are a form of art in and amongst themselves .",pos
4,cv414,10518,37,"don't count tarantino out when it comes to using the camera , however .",pos
4,cv414,10518,38,"there's a scene where max is unwittingly watching a dry run of a money exchange , and he's not really sure what's happening , but by composing the scene just so , his realization of what's going on is felt simultaneously by the audience .",pos
4,cv414,10518,39,"we look at the screen and think , "" gee , that's clever , "" and then think the same thing about how the film induced us into that wonderful feeling of catching on .",pos
4,cv414,10518,40,"although tarantino isn't afraid to drag out a shot for dramatic effect , it unfortunately works to varying degrees in this film .",pos
4,cv414,10518,41,"there are shots where a character is simply driving , and we watch this person and somehow get an idea of what is going on in his or her head .",pos
4,cv414,10518,42,this is a tribute to both direction and acting .,pos
4,cv414,10518,43,"however , there is at least one other scene where we follow jackie through a mall , and she is looking for something ; desperately looking for something .",pos
4,cv414,10518,44,"we get the idea of the frantic nature of her search , but we follow her for so long that we end up not really caring about what she's looking for , but instead hoping she'll just stop .",pos
4,cv414,10518,45,"overall , viewing jackie brown is time spent well .",pos
4,cv414,10518,46,"some flap has already been made about the language used in the film , but it's really not much worse than many of the other movies out there today .",pos
4,cv414,10518,47,"in fact , one might even be able to say that the way in which these "" offensive "" words are employed almost cause them to parody themselves and therefore transcend their own offensiveness .",pos

4,cv415,22517,7,"with seven new sequences and one old favorite , fantasia 2000 exhibits an imagination and respect for its art form that is absent from most other feature films .",pos
4,cv415,22517,8,"like the original , fantasia 2000 will more than likely bore the very young , although there is more narrative appeal in this newer version and the segments appear to be substantially shorter , perhaps a nod to the shorter attention span of the studio's primary audience .",pos
4,cv415,22517,9,"ranging from the silly to the sublime , each segment is preceded by a short , humorous introduction or interstitial by a guest celebrity host , steve martin ( bowfinger ) being the first and most effective .",pos

4,cv415,22517,19,a positive note is that the studio has avoided any segment which is as perversely dark as nihgt on bald mountain upon which the original film ended .,pos
4,cv415,22517,20,"there are some images based upon fantasy such as the flying whales in respighi's pines of rome or images which have their roots in mythology such as the ethereal creatures which tell the story of nature's cycle of life , death , and rebirth in igor stravinsky's firebird suite .",pos
4,cv415,22517,21,"but the stories they tell are uplifting , containing nothing too frightening for our younger children .",pos

4,cv420,28795,4,"everything you see in the film is rendered in great detail : individual threads in the fabric , individual strands of hair swaying , wrinkles and pimples on skin , incredible water effects .",pos

4,cv420,28795,20,"for the most part , it's bearable considering the genre , but tedious speeches and cheesy lines don't do anything to help the actors and can get annoying in the longer scenes .",pos

4,cv421,9709,53,"verhoeven likes to push the envelope of the mpaa , but despite all the violence , the comic book feel gives the film a sense of falsehood .",pos

4,cv421,9709,55,"the r rating is well deserved , and hopefully parents will not allow their 12 year old children to see it .",pos
4,cv421,9709,56,my guess is that verhoeven's target audience is the 18 to 25 male group .,pos
4,cv421,9709,57,"the film has a testosterone level off the charts , with chiseled men and beautiful women .",pos

4,cv421,9709,70,"however , he does give a good performance .",pos
4,cv421,9709,71,michael ironside gives the best performance of the film as the teacher with one arm .,pos
4,cv421,9709,72,his performance rises above the rest .,pos
4,cv421,9709,73,"perhaps it is because his character is the most developed , but i think it is just ironside's presence on screen .",pos
4,cv421,9709,74,"unfortunately , no particular cast member gives a star-making performance , which is too bad because the material here could have made many of the cast members stars .",pos

4,cv421,9709,83,"amazingly , with all the wars and romance going on , the screenplay manages to include some surprising governmental issues .",pos
4,cv421,9709,84,"in fact , these governmental changes seem fairly plausible , and this adds another layer to the story .",pos
4,cv421,9709,85,"the moral debate of the characters is quite surprising to find in a film of this genre , but what is even more surprising is the amount of humor included into all the carnage .",pos

4,cv426,10421,15,she deflects her husband's affections as she fears that he is beginning to fall in love with his client .,pos

4,cv427,10825,6,"that's the premise for deceiver , a new thriller from the pate brothers , jonas and josh , who made their mark on the film world two years ago at sundance with the movie the grave .",pos
4,cv427,10825,7,"deceiver plays out like a mind game between the intellectually superior wayland and the two not- so-bright cops ( captions early in the proceedings let us know that wayland's iq is 151 ; by contrast , kennesaw's is 122 and braxton's is 102 ) .",pos

4,cv427,10825,14,the foibles and failings of these three are brought into the open as the mystery around elizabeth's death deepens and it becomes unclear who has the upper hand : the suspect or his questioners .,pos
4,cv427,10825,15,"deceiver , which mostly transpires in a dimly-lit room and involves a lot of smart dialogue , has the feel of a david mamet play : edgy , claustrophobic , and tense .",pos
4,cv427,10825,16,"the atmosphere is explosive , and some of pivotal moments of confrontation are riveting .",pos
4,cv427,10825,17,deceiver has the power to grab an audience .,pos
4,cv427,10825,18,"unfortunately , in the end , it succumbs to the need to throw in one last , unexpected twist , and this is its undoing .",pos
4,cv427,10825,19,"for , while this surprise will certainly shock most viewers , it also stretches our credulity too much , and raises more questions than it answers .",pos
4,cv427,10825,20,it's only an effective wrap-up if you don't think too carefully about its full implications .,pos
4,cv427,10825,21,"of course , the film as a whole plays fast and loose with reality and logic .",pos
4,cv427,10825,22,police procedure is totally ignored and it's almost impossible to accept that any criminal investigation would or could proceed in this manner .,pos
4,cv427,10825,23,"but the real focus in deceiver is on character interaction , not plot details .",pos
4,cv427,10825,24,"deceiver only occasionally gets out of the police station , and those instances occur primarily during flashbacks featuring the prostitute .",pos
4,cv427,10825,25,the pates employ a number of interesting techniques to present vignettes from elizabeth's final days and hours .,pos
4,cv427,10825,26,the most intriguing of these is to use an unreliable narrator while underlining the discrepancies in his voice-over by visually showing what really happened .,pos
4,cv427,10825,27,moments like this are too effective to be dismissed as gimmicks .,pos
4,cv427,10825,28,"the movie , obviously fashioned in the manner of classic film noir , drips atmosphere .",pos

4,cv427,10825,31,"some of the things he tries ( mostly those that involve the contrast between light and shadow ) work exceptionally well , while others ( like any of several lazy susan shots ) seem more like unnecessary visual tricks .",pos
4,cv427,10825,32,"as wayland , tim roth gives the film's top performance , despite occasionally treading the tightrope between acting and overacting .",pos

4,cv427,10825,34,"the other two leads , chris penn and michael rooker , aren't as effective .",pos
4,cv427,10825,35,both play their characters like familiar types .,pos
4,cv427,10825,36,penn's performance is uninspired ; rooker's lacks subtlety .,pos
4,cv427,10825,37,some of the best work is turned in by the supporting actors .,pos
4,cv427,10825,38,"renee zellweger , in a role that's miles away from her star-making turn in jerry maguire , brings a note of vulnerability and humanity to a part that could easily have become a caricature .",pos
4,cv427,10825,39,"rosanna arquette is solid as kennesaw's wife , and michael parks delivers several wonderful scenes as a psychiatrist who's entrusted with evaluating wayland's condition .",pos
4,cv427,10825,40,one of the best things about deceiver is that it never talks down to the audience .,pos
4,cv427,10825,41,"plot points aren't hammered home , and , although the ending has its weaknesses , everything isn't spelled out in bold letters .",pos

4,cv431,7085,9,"suffice to say that this artfully paced study of a woman suffering a nervous breakdown offers an intriguing plot , loads of atmosphere and solid acting , though the dialogue is somewhat weakened by the dubbing into english .",pos

4,cv432,14224,17,"this is in stark contrast to joel schumacher's contrived vision in batman and robin , reflecting the dated atmosphere in the 1960's television show .",pos
4,cv432,14224,18,"batman and robin proved that the director failed to realize one fundamental fact : comics have grown up , and so has the audience ( i'm working on a scathing review of batman and robin and will post it up when i'm ready ) .",pos

4,cv432,14224,35,"regardless , this film is far from perfect .",pos

4,cv432,14224,41,"while vampire disintegration scenes are intriguing to watch , other cgi ( computer generated imagery ) effects are almost slapped together , which is surprising when given the amount of time the film was given to be released ( the film's release date was pushed back multiple times ) .",pos

4,cv434,5793,7,i'm sure many of us living in this part of the world have never seen tornadoes ( or twisters ) before .,pos
4,cv434,5793,8,"i for one , have only seen the devastating effects and footage of tornadoes from news reports on tv and personally , i feel tornado-caused destruction comes no where near the destruction caused by hurricanes and earthquakes . . . . . . . . that is until i saw twister .",pos
4,cv434,5793,9,the destruction caused by twisters may be precise ( not widespread but it moves very fast and its path of destruction is unpredictable .,pos
4,cv434,5793,10,"it will suck in cars , houses , livestock , etc . . . . .",pos
4,cv434,5793,11,"basically anything in its path that is not firmly rooted to the ground and in twister , you'll get to see all this - close up !",pos
4,cv434,5793,12,twister tells a tale about a group of storm chasers .,pos
4,cv434,5793,13,"these people are basically out-of-their-mind and for the sake of obtaining data on twister-occurrences , they risk their lives by literally chasing tornadoes , trying to get as close as they can . . . . . that",pos
4,cv434,5793,14,is if the tornado does not suddenly decide to change its path towards them !,pos
4,cv434,5793,15,jo ( helen hunt ) is the leader of this pack of kamikazes .,pos
4,cv434,5793,16,"while they are gearing up for the mother-of-all-storms as predicted by satellite recon , bill ( bill paxton ) , a former co- leader of the team returns to settle some divorce papers with jo .",pos
4,cv434,5793,17,"apparently , bill has left his rogue-ish days for greener and more practical pastures - as a television weatherman .",pos
4,cv434,5793,18,"he catches up with his old-self and follows the pack like the good ole days , bringing his wife-to-be melissa ( jamie gertz ) along , a city-bred woman toting around with a handphone .",pos
4,cv434,5793,19,jo has finally implemented bills initial idea of a device called dorothy which measurement's of a twister may lead to a better understanding on how tornadoes are formed so that a more reliable early-warning system can be implemented .,pos
4,cv434,5793,20,"the problem is , the device has to be placed very near the twister , and in its path ( which is practically unpredictable ) of destruction in order for it to function .",pos
4,cv434,5793,21,"to add to their current challenge , there is another group of storm chasers that is corporation-funded led by jonas ( cary elwes ) and they too have a similar device .",pos
4,cv434,5793,22,"thus begins the race ; jo's cheap government equipment with beaten-up vehicles against jonas's high-tech computers and satellite link-ups with their sleek , black all-terrain vans .",pos
4,cv434,5793,23,"plot wise , there are not really anything to shout about .",pos
4,cv434,5793,24,twister is as predictable as any summer box-office hit can get .,pos
4,cv434,5793,25,"there is the danger of the twister , the competition with jonas^os more well-off team and of course , the settling of differences between jo and bill ( this part gives the film its human substance ) .",pos
4,cv434,5793,26,"helen hunt , bill paxton and the rest of the actors/actresses give only average performances and all of them take back seat to the main thespian in this movie - the twister itself !",pos
4,cv434,5793,27,"thanks to the impressive digital effects by ilm ( lucasfilm's industrial light and magic ) , we get to see the terror and destruction caused by tornadoes up close ; from stripping barns and houses to lifting up livestock !",pos
4,cv434,5793,28,jan de bont once again proves his visual abiility ( thanks to his years of experience as a director of photography for action films ) for action sequences .,pos

4,cv434,5793,31,the surround sound effects sure does help a lot in stressing the terror of a twister !,pos

4,cv435,23110,0,there are times when the success of a particular film depends entirely on one actor's effort .,pos
4,cv435,23110,1,often a single performance can turn what might have been a rather mediocre movie into something worthwhile .,pos
4,cv435,23110,2,"when one of these comes along , i usually try to think about how many other people put work into the movie , that there is no way one person could possible carry the entire project on his shoulders .",pos
4,cv435,23110,3,"but sometimes there is simply no other explanation , and such is the case with "" the hurricane . """,pos
4,cv435,23110,4,"this biopic about falsely convicted boxer rubin "" hurricane "" carter would normally be called "" norman jewison's 'the hurricane , ' "" as per the tradition of referring to a film "" belonging "" to a director .",pos
4,cv435,23110,5,"but though he does decent work , jewison cannot claim ownership of "" the hurricane , "" because there is one reason this film works at all , and his name is denzel washington .",pos
4,cv435,23110,6,"washington plays carter , a boxer who in 1967 was convicted of a late-night shooting in a bar .",pos
4,cv435,23110,7,"jailed for 20 years , he maintained that he had never committed the crimes , but remained in jail after a second trial and countless appeals .",pos
4,cv435,23110,8,the situation changed when a group of canadians moved to washington and worked on freeing carter .,pos
4,cv435,23110,9,"through the efforts of that group and carter's lawyers , he was eventually freed when their case was heard in federal court and the judge ruled that rubin carter had been unfairly convicted .",pos
4,cv435,23110,10,"the film details carter's childhood , which had him in and out of jail because of the efforts of a racist cop ( dan hedaya ) .",pos
4,cv435,23110,11,"when he finally got out of prison for good , carter became a rising star as a middleweight pro boxer , seemingly having his career on track , until the police framed him for multiple homicide .",pos
4,cv435,23110,12,"despite the efforts of political activists and celebrities , he remained imprisoned .",pos
4,cv435,23110,13,"flash forward to 1983 , when lesra ( vicellous reon shannon ) a young african-american boy , living with a group of canadian tutors , reads the book carter wrote while in prison .",pos
4,cv435,23110,14,"the book , entitled "" the sixteenth round , "" opens young lesra's eyes to the injustice that was carter's life , and he vows to help free the incarcerated boxer .",pos
4,cv435,23110,15,"lesra convinces his canadian friends ( deborah unger , liev schreiber , john hannah ) to work with him towards his goal .",pos
4,cv435,23110,16,""" the hurricane "" leans on denzel washington .",pos
4,cv435,23110,17,"he must carry virtually every scene by sheer force of will , and he does so brilliantly .",pos
4,cv435,23110,18,"it's probably accurate to say that washington does not embody rubin carter , because he plays a character far stronger and nobler than any real person could hope to be .",pos
4,cv435,23110,19,it would perhaps be more accurate to say that washington embodies the character of rubin carter--a fictional personality invented solely for the film .,pos
4,cv435,23110,20,"the actor's work is masterful ; washington throws himself into every moment , refusing to keep the audience at arm's length .",pos
4,cv435,23110,21,"we feel everything he feels : the humiliation of having to return to prison after fighting so hard to make something of his life , the pain of having to order his wife to give up the fight , and the utter despair he feels when coming to the conclusion that all hope is lost .",pos
4,cv435,23110,22,washington's is a performance of weight and emotional depth .,pos
4,cv435,23110,23,"he doesn't merely play angry , happy , or sad ; he feels it at the deepest level .",pos
4,cv435,23110,24,"his work is masterful , and for half of this film i realized that the scene i was watching would not have been nearly as affecting as it was if it had been in the hands of another actor .",pos
4,cv435,23110,25,"norman jewison directs the film , doing a reasonably good job of pacing and shot selection .",pos
4,cv435,23110,26,""" the hurricane "" moves quickly , with no scene drawn out much further than necessary and the narrative galloping along nicely .",pos
4,cv435,23110,27,"jewison handles his multiple flashbacks well ; the audience is always aware of just what the time and place of each scene is , and nothing is terribly confusing .",pos
4,cv435,23110,28,"his boxing scenes , constructed with clear inspiration from "" raging bull , "" get inside the action very well , and they are believable as real sports footage .",pos
4,cv435,23110,29,"jewison puts together a particularly nice scene by utilizing a pretty cool trick : carter is sent to solitary confinement for 90 days when he refuses to wear a prison uniform , and jewison , assisted by some wonderful acting from a game washington , shows how carter gradually starts to lose his mind during the constant solitude , and eventually we get three rubin carters arguing with each other in one cell .",pos
4,cv435,23110,30,"jewison's best achievement in "" the hurricane "" is succeeding at showing how carter becomes an embittered man during his hard-knock life , and how he is able to break out of that bitterness and learn to trust people again .",pos
4,cv435,23110,31,"sadly , though , the film's chief failures lie with the screenplay , as with most of the good-but-not-great efforts to round the pike this winter .",pos
4,cv435,23110,32,"there is much to interest a viewer in "" the hurricane , "" but it seems that every time the film gets a chance to take the most clich ? d route possible , it does .",pos
4,cv435,23110,33,"take a look at the supporting characters , for example , who are drawn up as either entirely good or entirely evil .",pos
4,cv435,23110,34,"carter and lesra ( played nicely by shannon , who deserves credit ) are the only real people here ; everyone else is a stereotype .",pos
4,cv435,23110,35,the canadians are good .,pos
4,cv435,23110,36,the cops are bad .,pos
4,cv435,23110,37,"the canadians spend most of their time dolefully grinning at each other in their lovey-dovey commune ( and it is a commune , despite the film's failure to make that clear ) , while every racist cop ( especially dan hedaya's ) melts in out of the shadows and glowers at every black person that enters the room .",pos
4,cv435,23110,38,"much of the dialogue comes off as rather hokey ( "" hate put me in prison .",pos
4,cv435,23110,39,"love's gonna bust me out . "" ) , and the big courtroom climax during which everyone gets to make an impassioned speech could have been lifted from a made-for-tv lifetime special .",pos
4,cv435,23110,40,it's too bad .,pos
4,cv435,23110,41,"the cast is game , the director does his job , and the subject matter is interesting , but the script takes the safer , slightly more boring route far too often .",pos
4,cv435,23110,42,"i wanted a real reason for the cop to hold a grudge against carter other than "" he's a racist pig . """,pos
4,cv435,23110,43,i wanted more evidence that these canadians are real people with faults and virtues instead of a bunch of saintly crusaders looking for justice .,pos
4,cv435,23110,44,"in short , i wanted to see the film through a less distorted lens .",pos
4,cv435,23110,45,"criticism has been levied against the liberties "" the hurricane "" takes with the truth of what really happened to carter , and much of it is deserved .",pos
4,cv435,23110,46,"for example , the film gives us a boxing scene showing carter pummeling defending champ joey giardello , only to be screwed by the judges , who ruled giardello the winner .",pos
4,cv435,23110,47,"most accounts of the fight , however , have carter losing fairly .",pos
4,cv435,23110,48,"furthermore , much of carter's criminal past is conveniently left out of the film , and just why he was convicted again in his second trial is never really explained .",pos
4,cv435,23110,49,"of course , "" the hurricane "" works mainly as a fable , so digressions from the truth can be excused at least partially , but even dismissing such issues don't remove one fact : "" the hurricane "" is a highly flawed film .",pos
4,cv435,23110,50,"only one actor could have made a schmaltzy , predictable picture like this work as well as it does , and it's a good thing "" the hurricane "" has that actor .",pos
4,cv435,23110,51,"carter has been quoted as saying , "" denzel washington is making me look good , "" but he's not the only one .",pos
4,cv435,23110,52,washington makes this film look good .,pos
4,cv435,23110,53,"denzel washington's "" the hurricane . """,pos

4,cv436,19179,2,"we first meet ellie at a giant radio telescope in puerto rico , where she is part of the seti ( search for extraterrestrial intelligence ) project .",pos
4,cv436,19179,3,"her research is quickly killed , however , by her highly political david drumlin ( tom skerrit ) , who disdains "" pure research "" in favor of science with "" commercial applications .",pos
4,cv436,19179,4,she goes in search of private funding and is turned down at every step until she pitches her project to a corporation run by the mysterious s . r .,pos
4,cv436,19179,5,hadden ( john hurt ) .,pos
4,cv436,19179,6,"then , with that money just about to finally dry up , ellie is sitting out in the desert near the very large array in new mexico when she hears over her headphones a very powerful pulsing radio signal .",pos
4,cv436,19179,7,"in the movie's most exciting and believable sequence , ellie and her coworkers determine that the signal has to be coming from the star vega .",pos
4,cv436,19179,8,"at first the signal appears to be just sequences of prime numbers , then it turns out to be a tv signal of the berlin olympics bounced back to earth from 50 years before .",pos
4,cv436,19179,9,"further decoding , with hadden's help , reveals another layer to message , containing detailed plans for a massive and complex machine .",pos
4,cv436,19179,10,it appears that the machine is a transport that will allow one person to travel to the aliens' home world .,pos
4,cv436,19179,11,"of course , the big question becomes "" who gets to ride it ? """,pos
4,cv436,19179,12,"( right after "" who's gonna pay for this thing ? "" ) .",pos
4,cv436,19179,13,"to boil it down , ellie gets denied the seat in the machine because she bluntly acknowledges her atheism , while drumlin gets to go because he rather insincerely professes his deep religious faith .",pos

4,cv436,19179,25,ellie arroway is a well-rounded character portrayed by one of the best actresses currently working .,pos
4,cv436,19179,26,"neither the character nor the performance has the same depth as clarice starling in silence of the lambs , but that's a tough standard to meet .",pos
4,cv436,19179,27,ellie is interesting in that she is woman defined by a strange array of father figures .,pos
4,cv436,19179,28,her real father is an idealized movie dad who does nothing in the film but love his daughter unconditionally .,pos
4,cv436,19179,29,drumlin comes across as a distant stepfather to whom ellie is like an irritating teenager who wants to use his toys to get into trouble .,pos
4,cv436,19179,30,"hadden obviously has affection for ellie , but in the end he seems to see her as his creation , nothing more than his favorite piece on the chess board .",pos
4,cv436,19179,31,"even palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) , ellie's love interest , takes a paternalistic interest in ellie , seeing her as a misguided person who needs protection from her own impulses .",pos
4,cv436,19179,32,"the film is technically impressive , especially in the scenes where the message is first received and during the destruction of the first machine .",pos
4,cv436,19179,33,the part of the film dealing with the message has the best presentation of real science in a film since the andromeda strain .,pos
4,cv436,19179,34,"the film falls apart when dealing with its central theme , the dichotomy between science and religion .",pos
4,cv436,19179,35,this is a very real debate but contact boils it down to a simplistic level that never really touches on the actual issues involved .,pos
4,cv436,19179,36,the film presents science pretty well ( until the end ) so the real problem stems from it presentation of religious faith .,pos
4,cv436,19179,37,religious people are presented as shallow caricatures .,pos

4,cv436,19179,40,"the only really fleshed-out religious person , palmer joss , is supposed to be a minister of some sort , but his actual faith is left pretty vague .",pos
4,cv436,19179,41,i can't even say for certain that he was supposed to be a christian .,pos
4,cv436,19179,42,all we know is that he dropped out of the seminary and obviously has no qualms about pre-marital sex .,pos
4,cv436,19179,43,"the film drops the science ball at the very end , when ellie appears to assert that there are some things even scientists must take on faith .",pos
4,cv436,19179,44,"in a day and age when the theory of evolution is denounced by the religion right as an atheist "" religious "" doctrine , this is exactly the wrong message to send .",pos
4,cv436,19179,45,"in a movie dealing with issues of science and faith , the last thing you want your scientist character to do is abandon the principle of scientific skepticism .",pos
4,cv436,19179,46,"what ellie should have said was , "" you shouldn't believe me .",pos

4,cv441,13711,20,it makes saving private ryan a lot more powerful than an testosterone-driven stallone movie mission .,pos

4,cv441,13711,35,spielberg was apparently following the james cameron line of thought that any three-hour movie about the past should be framed by a self-contained prologue and epilogue that takes place in the present .,pos
4,cv441,13711,36,"much more effective are subtler scenes , like the one where several of hanks' men are rifling thrugh a bag of dogtags from dead soldiers , and they make light of what they're doing by pretending they're playing poker .",pos

4,cv442,13846,19,"they are sitting ducks and we realize this through the perspective of the well-secured germans who can actually see who , what , and where they're shooting , unlike the americans who must fire in a general direction to avoid getting their heads blown off .",pos
4,cv442,13846,20,"perhaps the film is flawed by not providing any backstory on the war itself and who the men really are , but that seems to be part of the theme .",pos
4,cv442,13846,21,"the film seems to rely on the audience's sense of patriotism , that the american military is "" right "" and good and that the nazis are "" inherently evil . """,pos

4,cv442,13846,41,"a few battles are fought , not to be major accomplishments for the war , but because they encounter german soldiers and have no other choice .",pos
4,cv442,13846,42,the act of killing itself becomes one of the film's major philosophical metaphors .,pos
4,cv442,13846,43,"the soldiers don't mind killing other soldiers in blind battle , but when they come across a lone survivor who begs them to let him go , they can barely stop themselves from killing him in cold blood as some kind of vengeance for their losses .",pos
4,cv442,13846,44,"unfortunately , death is a fact of war , and most films try to avoid it when it comes to the main characters , but here spielberg doesn't want us to think these men are invincible .",pos
4,cv442,13846,45,"in fact , only a small amount of color and personality is sketched into each man , and the performances are good enough to make this method work .",pos

4,cv452,5088,17,screenwriters larry ferguson and donald stewart have gracefully navigated red october through a story line full of twists and turns .,pos
4,cv452,5088,18,they keep us involved in the action by unveiling plot strands at just the right moment .,pos
4,cv452,5088,19,"the movie doesn't get as sweaty or breathless as die hard , because it would rather tell a good story than hit you over the head with non-stop action .",pos

4,cv453,10379,1,"with a budget topping $200 million , i was quite skeptical about whether throwing all that money toward one of the twentieth century's greatest tragedies would make a film exciting enough to see .",pos

4,cv453,10379,6,"after having viewed titanic , however , i found it to be a well-paced , well-designed , and overall well-made movie .",pos
4,cv453,10379,7,"there have been many films made about the maiden and final voyage of the ocean liner titanic , but this latest offering from director james cameron is the best i've seen .",pos
4,cv453,10379,8,titanic tells its story in two time periods .,pos
4,cv453,10379,9,"it starts out in the present , when ocean explorer brock lovett ( bill paxton ) and his team are exploring the wreckage of the titanic on the floor of the atlantic , searching for a priceless diamond necklace which supposedly went down with the ship .",pos
4,cv453,10379,10,"what they find instead is a drawing of a woman wearing the necklace , which is broadcast on the news .",pos

4,cv453,10379,12,there she tells her story to lovett and his team .,pos
4,cv453,10379,13,"in 1912 , rose dewitt bukater ( kate winslett ) , a young lady belonging to society's upper class , boards the titanic for the ship's first atlantic crossing , from southampton , england to new york .",pos
4,cv453,10379,14,"she is engaged to cal hockley ( billy zane ) , an heir to old money , and a snob in every sense of the word .",pos
4,cv453,10379,15,"on board , rose feels the stifling trappings of high-society's expectations , and resolves to escape from it all by throwing herself off the titanic's stern , but is saved from her self-proclaimed fate by jack dawson ( leonardo dicaprio ) , a passenger in third-class ( "" steerage "" , as it's referred to ) , who talks her out of jumping .",pos
4,cv453,10379,16,"although for rose the attraction is not immediate , a love affair soon develops between the two , which endangers rose's social standing as well as her engagement to the jealous cal .",pos
4,cv453,10379,17,"the story sounds very simple , and perhaps even unexciting , but through solid performances by the leads and good direction by cameron , a good movie comes through .",pos
4,cv453,10379,18,"dicaprio is marvelous as the young , but worldly-wise jack , playing the role with the confidence usually found in older actors .",pos
4,cv453,10379,19,"his is a character that is immediately likable , as he knows what he wants out of life and is charmingly able to handle a variety of situations .",pos
4,cv453,10379,20,girls are going to swoon over him .,pos
4,cv453,10379,21,"winslet also proves herself a good actress , delivering her lines convincingly , and the quality of performances between winslet and dicaprio makes the relationship believable .",pos
4,cv453,10379,22,the only problem with winslet is that she does not carry herself in accordance with her character's upbringing .,pos
4,cv453,10379,23,"simply by judgment of her gait , i was distracted from the fact that she was supposed to be an upper-crust debutante .",pos
4,cv453,10379,24,"rather than demonstrate the poise one would expect her character to possess , she sometimes looks positively clumsy , and it unfortunately detracts from her otherwise great acting .",pos
4,cv453,10379,25,"billy zane is cast well as the aristocratic snob cal , since he has a certain look that immediately makes you want to hate him .",pos
4,cv453,10379,26,"his features are such that even when he smiles , there's something mistrustful about him , and when he scowls , he is evil incarnate .",pos
4,cv453,10379,27,"he's something like a porcelain version of peter gallagher , but a cheaper model .",pos
4,cv453,10379,28,"like dicaprio and winslet , zane slips comfortably into his role and plays it well .",pos
4,cv453,10379,29,"backing up zane is david warner as lovejoy , cal's personal assistant ( or "" man "" as they said at the turn of the century ) .",pos
4,cv453,10379,30,"no matter who else is in the cast , you can always count on a good performance by warner , who seems to be made to play the distinguished gentleman with a gaze of steel and will to match .",pos
4,cv453,10379,31,"additionally , there are a number of smaller fictional and non-fictional roles thrown in for color , such as kathy bates as "" the unsinkable "" molly brown , danny nucci as jack's friend fabrizio de rossi , eric braeden as john jacob astor , and even bernard fox as colonel archibald gracie .",pos
4,cv453,10379,32,nice to see dr . bombay getting work .,pos
4,cv453,10379,33,also scattered about are some of the other steerage passengers who are basically in the movie so you can feel sorry for them when they die .,pos
4,cv453,10379,34,"this by itself may have been largely compulsory in a film about the titanic , but it transcends this status by putting these characters in direct conflict with the ship's crewmembers who strive to maintain order and assure that the first-class passengers are placed aboard the lifeboats before anyone else .",pos
4,cv453,10379,35,"in this way , titanic possesses a depth not usually found in action pictures .",pos
4,cv453,10379,36,"you don't just get a love story with a tragedy as a backdrop , but a very real account of class struggle as well .",pos
4,cv453,10379,37,"as i mentioned before , the budget for this film was tremendous , and it certainly showed in the set dressing and special effects .",pos
4,cv453,10379,38,"the interiors of the titanic are nearly breathtaking with their elaborate trimmings and intricate detail , and one has very little doubt that the layouts are authentic .",pos
4,cv453,10379,39,"with regard to the exteriors , i would dare anyone to point out a film in which a vessel has been recreated with such meticulousness or on such a scale .",pos
4,cv453,10379,40,"cameron actually built a scale model of the titanic in a water tank , but only had room for 90% , and therefore had to computer-generate the remaining 40 feet .",pos
4,cv453,10379,41,"could've fooled me and everyone else in the theater , as the splicing is seamless .",pos
4,cv453,10379,42,also of note in this film is the way the audience is presented with the anatomy of the disaster right at the beginning .,pos
4,cv453,10379,43,"we are told of where the iceberg struck the ship , how the flooding occurred , the way the ship sank , and why it did so in that manner .",pos
4,cv453,10379,44,"these technical details serve as a guide for later on when the action starts happening , and allow us to view the sinking with informed analytic detraction , in addition to the more conventional placement in the midst of mayhem and confusion .",pos
4,cv453,10379,45,"in all , james cameron's titanic is a good blend of love story , history , and action .",pos
4,cv453,10379,46,"the fact that the film runs longer than most at about three hours is almost unnoticed as the viewer's attention is held alternately by those three main elements , from the movie's intriguing beginning to it's satisfactory ending .",pos
4,cv453,10379,47,"in box office receipts , titanic the movie will undoubtedly live up to the unsinkable expectations of titanic the ship .",pos
4,cv454,2053,0,it was easy to fear the worst .,pos
4,cv454,2053,1,"begin with a classic 1960's television series , add a big budget and an a-list star in the lead role , and stir .",pos
4,cv454,2053,2,"script , you ask ?",pos
4,cv454,2053,3,"who needs one , kid . . .",pos
4,cv454,2053,4,we've got ourselves a formula .,pos
4,cv454,2053,5,that was my fear : a bloated monster without any sense of direction .,pos

4,cv454,2053,7,didn't .,pos
4,cv454,2053,8,"the fugitive is as lean , taut and tense as anything the action genre has produced in the last several years .",pos

4,cv454,2053,10,"expect box office to go through the roof , deservedly , and expect an academy award nomination for tommy lee jones .",pos
4,cv454,2053,11,the premise is a simple one .,pos
4,cv454,2053,12,"dr . richard kimble ( harrison ford ) is wrongly convicted for the murder of his wife after struggling with the real killer , a man with an artificial arm .",pos
4,cv454,2053,13,"after an escape attempt by some other prisoners during a transfer goes awry , kimble finds himself on the run .",pos
4,cv454,2053,14,his one goal : to find the one-armed man ( andreas katsulas ) before u . s . marshall sam gerard ( tommy lee jones ) finds him .,pos
4,cv454,2053,15,"where the fugitive surprises the most is the script , by jeb stuart and david twohy .",pos
4,cv454,2053,16,"in a genre where one is almost always asked to allow leaps of logic , the script repeatedly astonished me with its intelligence , its attention to detail and its respect for the audience .",pos
4,cv454,2053,17,"in an early sequence , kimble sneaks into a hospital to shave of his beard , slick back his hair and change into a lab coat .",pos
4,cv454,2053,18,"on his way out , a police officer jokingly tells the man he doesn't know is kimble to zip up his pants .",pos
4,cv454,2053,19,"it's a small moment , but it punches home the urgency of kimble's situation , and exactly what a man concerned about not being recognized might easily forget .",pos
4,cv454,2053,20,"later , while trying to lose himself in a parade , kimble thinks to drop his overcoat , the most likely way he'd be recognized from behind .",pos
4,cv454,2053,21,"it's these details which convince us that when a colleague of kimble's tells gerard that he's too smart to be caught , he may just be right .",pos
4,cv454,2053,22,credit must also be given to the special effects and stunt coordinators .,pos
4,cv454,2053,23,"the bus crash which allows kimble's escape is a spectacular sequence , as is a leap from a dam into the water below .",pos
4,cv454,2053,24,"the action is crisp and brutal , and never romanticized .",pos
4,cv454,2053,25,special kudos go to director davis for maintaining a relentless pace which underscores the single-mindedness of the two leads .,pos
4,cv454,2053,26,and what a pair of performances those leads are .,pos
4,cv454,2053,27,"tommy lee jones is nothing short of brilliant as gerard , because he manages an incredibly challenging feat .",pos
4,cv454,2053,28,"for the first third of the film , there is really no * villain * per se ; kimble is on the run , and gerard is out to find him .",pos
4,cv454,2053,29,"it would have been very easy to turn gerard into a malevolent , vindictive inspector javert , but that never happens .",pos
4,cv454,2053,30,"instead jones plays him as a sharp , committed man who's just doing his job , so that when he responds to kimble's comment , "" i didn't kill my wife , "" with a matter-of-fact , "" i don't care , "" we know exactly what he means .",pos
4,cv454,2053,31,it's not his job to determine guilt or innocence .,pos
4,cv454,2053,32,it's his job to bring in a fugitive .,pos
4,cv454,2053,33,this is a well- written character played with relish by an actor at the top of his form .,pos
4,cv454,2053,34,"the only unfortunate thing about jones' stunning turn is that it's likely to overshadow harrison ford , and that's a shame .",pos
4,cv454,2053,35,"for his entire career , ford has been underappreciated as an actor due to his pigeonholing as an action hero .",pos
4,cv454,2053,36,"however , he does a fine job with the less flashy part of kimble , always keeping at the forefront the advantage this man has because of his intelligence .",pos
4,cv454,2053,37,"the fugitive could only work to its fullest if the two protagonists always seemed to be on equal footing , and ford is up to the task .",pos
4,cv454,2053,38,"this summer has been loaded with action/suspense films , and most of them have been doing brisk business .",pos

4,cv455,29000,8,"arguably more than any other living actor , harris , who also plays _pollock_ , embodies the archetypal working stiff , and his blue-collar demystification of pollock's labour-intensive art , both as performer and director , makes for unpretentious cinema .",pos

4,cv456,18985,15,"of course , there's the professor's daughter , jane ( nicely vocalized by a cheerful minnie driver ) who will help supply the romantic quotient of the movie .",pos
4,cv456,18985,16,the thing that blew my socks off about this version of tarzan is the stunning animation .,pos
4,cv456,18985,17,"directors chris buck and kevin lima have applied a breathtaking 3-d element to the movement of the athletic title character , and the fast-paced editing is absolutely a marvel .",pos

4,cv457,18453,3,star wars episode i : the phantom menace reviewed by vince yim,pos
4,cv457,18453,4,"never having been the biggest star wars fanatic in the world ( i was more into star trek : the next generation ) , it is difficult to relate to the mass fandom surrounding the latest installment , the phantom menace .",pos
4,cv457,18453,5,"however , it can't be ignored .",pos
4,cv457,18453,6,"endless toys lining the shelves , endless news reports , and a multi-billion dollar advertising campaign makes it all the more difficult .",pos
4,cv457,18453,7,"with the level of this hype , one would recall an overhyped disaster from 1998 , godzilla , which definitely failed to live up to expectations .",pos
4,cv457,18453,8,"thankfully , the phantom menace does much , much better .",pos
4,cv457,18453,9,"while the "" first "" star wars trilogy told the story of jedi knight luke skywalker , the prequels backpedal to tell the back-story of obi wan kenobi and a young jedi named anakin skywalker ( who would become the father of luke and eventually become darth vader ) .",pos
4,cv457,18453,10,"without blowing too much of the story , the phantom menace evolves around a peaceful planet naboo , which is being held hostage by a greedy trade federation , and it's up to two jedi knights ( qui-gon ji , played by liam neeson and obi-wan kenobi , played by ewan mcgreggor ) to free it .",pos
4,cv457,18453,11,"the phantom menace has taken a literal beating from various film critics , leaving me to lower my expectations somewhat .",pos
4,cv457,18453,12,"common complaints range from lack of characterization , weak narrative , poor direction of actors , the dated style , and too much focus over special effects .",pos
4,cv457,18453,13,"still , film critics often apply much historical theory in regards to film criticism , much of which the average film buff does not care for .",pos
4,cv457,18453,14,"hence , this film is a lot of fun and definitely an improvement over the previous films ( even with the "" improvements "" in the special editions ) .",pos
4,cv457,18453,15,"there are many memorable sequences throughout the film , ranging from the fast and furious "" pod race "" sequence ( which is a take on the chariot races in "" ben hur "" ) and the many fight scenes involving legions of battle droids .",pos
4,cv457,18453,16,"utilizing technology that is light years beyond anything made before , special effects and computers are used to create everything from monsters to robots to amazing cityscapes with incredible detail .",pos

4,cv457,18453,18,"the level of humour is a bit higher than the previous films as well , mostly conveyed through the reluctant hero jar jar binks , who belongs to a race known as the gungans .",pos
4,cv457,18453,19,"best described as an mr . bean from the planet naboo , he steals the show .",pos
4,cv457,18453,20,"unfortunately , being that he is a computer-generated character , tells a bit about the direction of the actors ( although natalie portman as the queen is pretty effective , as is jake lloyd as the young anakin skywalker ) .",pos
4,cv457,18453,21,"with star wars mania at an all time high , there is the risk that the film will disappoint ( i myself had my doubts ) , which this film does have a tendency to do at times .",pos
4,cv457,18453,22,"there are a few logic problems with the plot , several things are left unchecked , and at times seems to be made only for diehard star wars fans ( although the appearance of the tusken raiders makes for more than a few laughs ) .",pos
4,cv457,18453,23,"that , and young anakin skywalker is a really annoying character , coming off as a smarmy , arrogant brat ( with such an attitude , it's no wonder why he turns to the dark side ) .",pos
4,cv457,18453,24,"still , it seems that many people , especially critics , are missing the point .",pos
4,cv457,18453,25,"the film is some of the most fun 2 and a half hours that you'll blow in your life , which is something i wouldn't mind doing again .",pos

4,cv458,8604,12,and he is outrageous and convincing as a nihilistic atheist who nonetheless loves his ex-stripper wife dearly .,pos
4,cv458,8604,13,"the latter is played with abandon , conviction and sensitivity all at once by courtney love , who is the real star of the show and really snubbed of an academy award best actress nomination , if not of the award itself .",pos

4,cv458,8604,15,"the relationship between harrelson and love brings out another great paradox - superficially they are immoral outcasts who've had it coming ; woody gets shot and becomes paralysed from the waist down , and courtney dies of aids .",pos

4,cv458,8604,17,"but in the powerful love they have for each other , each standing by the other in turn , the two leads highlight the question how much is the nihilist still a moralist and ( in the american context ) a christian , if they can love and care , and feel just like anyone else on a personal level .",pos

4,cv475,21692,5,"it's very funny with smart and foul-mouthed dialogue while unexpectedly it has a serious undertone to it and besides going against god and jesus christ , it actually tries to tell people that there is such a thing rather than that there isn't .",pos

4,cv475,21692,9,it was hailed by critics as one of the best movies of the year and soon a sequel is coming .,pos

4,cv475,21692,21,"what a movie , it is everything rolled into one : an offensive , offbeat , smart and sassy comedy that surprisingly has a great message at the end , and ends up being a feel-good movie .",pos
4,cv475,21692,22,who would have known kevin had such a soft side on him that could make us know that he is a faithful person himself .,pos
4,cv475,21692,23,now for those of you who get offended with this movie really should not take it to heart .,pos
4,cv475,21692,24,"yes it may target the catholic community and bash them a lot , but it also seems to rather than go against god and heaven , it actually goes with god and kevin gives a message that there is a god .",pos
4,cv475,21692,25,this review may sound confusing at first but really the only way to understand it is to see this excellent movie .,pos
4,cv475,21692,26,kevin goes to new lengths in this hilarious comedy and gives us some great characters with not too much background or study and rather we start to know the characters as we watch the movie .,pos
4,cv475,21692,27,of course the best ( and funniest ) of them all is the only duo in history that have made me fall out of my chair laughing and that my friends are jay and silent bob .,pos
4,cv475,21692,28,probably the best characters in movies that i like .,pos
4,cv475,21692,29,"the star-studded cast is amazing and has some other cameos by george carlin , jeanne garafolo and so may more that we start to lose track after a while .",pos
4,cv475,21692,30,the script was written by kevin smith with many f'words in there of course and a strong emphasis on sexual talk but he also seems to concentrate on what is important rather that what isn't and makes us laugh at the same time as we think .,pos
4,cv475,21692,31,"chris rock gives a hilarious performance and gets into his character very well , with some classic lines .",pos
4,cv475,21692,32,linda fiorentino is just perfect for her role and makes us believe that she really is who she is .,pos
4,cv475,21692,33,of course jason mewes and kevin smith do a great job as jay and silent bob with some priceless lines from jay ( as well as silent bob ) .,pos
4,cv475,21692,34,"alan rickman , jason lee , salma hayek round out the cast with matt damon and ben affleck in the starring roles .",pos
4,cv475,21692,35,being oscar winners for the classic 'good will hunting' they give great performances here again but matt damon seems just a little held back and to me did not give it all he could .,pos
4,cv475,21692,36,ben however was all out and got very much into his character as well as the story .,pos
4,cv475,21692,37,the movie's only big flaw is that it has a few unfunny lines and some slow parts to go along with it .,pos
4,cv475,21692,38,"however the direction by kevin and the script by kevin as well as the priceless performance by many of the cast members , 'dogma' stands as a new classic and i think i can safely compare it to 'clerks' .",pos
4,cv475,21692,39,"while being funny at times , in the end it becomes a serious movie with an important message that some may not agree with but can't deny it .",pos
4,cv475,21692,40,"'dogma' will offend people , especially deeply religious people , but for those of you who are open minded and want to see some very funny material then this is the movie for you .",pos

4,cv476,16856,0,one of the most popular subplots in the entire science fiction genre is time travel .,pos
4,cv476,16856,1,"that concept , although many purists doubt its scientific credentials , spawned many interesting novels , comic books and films in the last century .",pos
4,cv476,16856,2,"however , the big grand-daddy of time travels , h . g . wells' novel the time machine , wasn't written with the intention to speculate about that concept or its consequences .",pos
4,cv476,16856,3,"the author , h . g . wells merely used it as a convenient way to express his socialist views and condemn the great social gap between the rich , idle capitalist class and impoverished labour .",pos
4,cv476,16856,4,"whatever intentions wells had , the future generations of readers were less impressed by his political messages .",pos
4,cv476,16856,5,instead they were fascinated by the idea that the strange new worlds could be explored without traveling trough space .,pos
4,cv476,16856,6,the novel became one of great classics of science fiction genre and it natural for filmmakers to use it as inspiration .,pos
4,cv476,16856,7,"first of them was george pal , who in 1960 directed film which would , through the years , become genre classic of its own .",pos
4,cv476,16856,8,"the plot revolves about george ( rod taylor ) , victorian scientist who discovered the way to travel through the fourth dimension - time .",pos
4,cv476,16856,9,"at the eve of the new 20th century , george gathers his friends in order to present them his invention - machine that would enable him to travel through time .",pos
4,cv476,16856,10,"they are skeptical , but that doesn't prevent george from carrying out his plan and traveling into the future .",pos
4,cv476,16856,11,"at first , he travels slowly , seeing london as it changes through the years and three world wars .",pos
4,cv476,16856,12,"finally , after witnessing world war three , he travels far into the future , hoping that he would cease to witness wars and senseless destructions .",pos
4,cv476,16856,13,"when he finally reaches year 802 , 701 ad , at first glance , new world looks like utopia - humanity consists of young , beautiful , but idle eloi , people who are fed , clothed and taken care of by unseen machines .",pos
4,cv476,16856,14,"but , weena ( yvette mimieux ) , eloi woman , tells george about another side of the coin - in the night , her people is preyed upon by morlocs , humanoid creatures from the underworld .",pos
4,cv476,16856,15,the time machine became the cinematic classic for the very same reason the novel became the classic in science fiction literature - the fantastic concept was a brilliant way for the authors to talk about burning issues and fears of their respective times .,pos
4,cv476,16856,16,"for h . g . wells it was frightening threat of class struggle ; for george pal and his screenwriter david duncan , who produced the film in the worst days of the cold war , it was the constant and more imminent threat of nuclear holocaust , underlined with the negative references to war throughout the movie .",pos
4,cv476,16856,17,"even the modern audience , which would be tempted to discard the film as old-fashioned , could find some values in its universal messages , fit for each era .",pos
4,cv476,16856,18,"compared with the genre films of today , the time machine is even better , and could serve as a good example how to make intelligent , thought-provoking films .",pos
4,cv476,16856,19,"of course , since this is hollywood product after all , the time machine delivers such concepts in the form of classic adventure , sometimes sacrificing plausibility for the sake of attractiveness .",pos
4,cv476,16856,20,"for example , it is hard to imagine that someone would be able to understand perfect english million years in future ; same is with morlocs degenerating into mutant monsters , while eloi remain undistinguished from the people of today .",pos
4,cv476,16856,21,"some of the final scenes , that turn victorian scientist into an action superhero , are also rather unconvincing .",pos
4,cv476,16856,22,"but , on the other hand , the film is very well directed , cleverly paced and the special effects , although definitely old-fashioned , are more than adequate for this kind of picture .",pos
4,cv476,16856,23,"the acting is good , with rod taylor in one of his most remembered roles , while in the same time alan young brings rather memorable performance as george's trusted friend filby .",pos
4,cv476,16856,24,"yvette mimieux , who plays weena , on the other hand , would be remembered more by her looks than by the complexity of her role .",pos
4,cv476,16856,25,"however , despite all those flaws , the time machine is a very good piece of cinema , something that connoisseurs of quality science-fiction films sorely miss these days .",pos
4,cv477,22479,0,"if this keeps up , jane austen ( sense and sensibility , pride and prejudice ) may have to apply for posthumous membership to the screen writers guild .",pos

4,cv477,22479,6,writer/director patricia rozema ( when night is falling ) is responsible for the textual changes .,pos
4,cv477,22479,7,"from a purely dramatic perspective , the revision makes perfect sense and improves the film's audience appeal .",pos
4,cv477,22479,8,"what ms . rozema has done is to infuse the main character with much of ms . austen's own personality by including excerpts from the author's journals , giving that dialogue to fanny .",pos
4,cv477,22479,9,the result is a central character that is immediately appealing .,pos
4,cv477,22479,10,"as the grown fanny , australian actress frances o'connor ( all about adam ) does wonderfully textured work .",pos
4,cv477,22479,11,"at times , ms . rozema has fanny address the camera directly to communicate many of the novel's more introspective observations .",pos
4,cv477,22479,12,this is a difficult device to work seamlessly into a period film and it is to ms . o'connor's credit that it works as well as it does .,pos

4,cv477,22479,17,"while mary and henry are evidently less than sincere in their affections , their presence does provide the movie and the main characters with the necessary conflict that keeps our interest until the film's appropriately austen-like ending .",pos

4,cv479,5649,12,acting on the whole was ok although i thought that bill pullman was a bit unsuitable for the president role but he did make a very rousing speech before sending his troops into battle ( do we smell a bit of braveheart here ? ? ) .,pos

4,cv479,5649,16,"however below that wafer-thin plot and on-screen flaws , id4 scored well in playing with the appealing idea of the entire world giving up their petty differences to unite themselves as one force against the alien invasion .",pos
4,cv479,5649,17,"an idea which will have the audience strongly rooting for the united front throughout the movie , thus maintaining a screen-viewer interaction that virtually render any holes in the movie acceptable , no matter how ridiculous .",pos
4,cv479,5649,18,"id4 was produced under a modest budget of us$68 million , a film of such magnitude would have easily been another waterworld but director roland emmerich ( universal soldier , stargate ) and producer dean devlin assembled a team which did their own special effects rather than commissioning it to ilm or any other special effects company .",pos
4,cv479,5649,19,"some of the effects are not too good but most of it are very believable , especially the epic standoff between 150 f-18's and 250 alien saucers , reminiscence of the classic space battle featured in return of the jedi .",pos
4,cv479,5649,20,id4 is a movie for all .,pos

4,cv489,17906,8,payback is often a very violent film .,pos
4,cv489,17906,9,"to its credit , there are a few scenes that could have been very graphic , but the director ( i'm not sure which one -- more about that in a second ) made the choice to let the audience use their imagination instead of subjecting us to the usual gratuitous gore found in many films .",pos
4,cv489,17906,10,"the film appears a bit disjointed in places , which is understandable considering producer / star gibson wasn't thrilled with how the film turned out and wanted parts of it re-shot .",pos
4,cv489,17906,11,"when the director refused , another one was brought in to do the re-shoot .",pos

4,cv490,17872,11,"maybe because "" leila "" is from iran , the film will unquestionably be shocking for american audiences , since the concept of polygamy is looked upon by the characters as a more or less everyday occurrence .",pos

4,cv490,17872,14,"it is this relationship that is the key ingredient to making what follows the opening scenes all the more powerful , and director mehrjui has succeeded just about as well as possible .",pos
4,cv490,17872,15,"although seemingly unimportant at first glance , an early sequence where leila and reza are eating dinner and both are laughing , nearly uncontrollably , actually is one of the most vital moments in the first half , as it unmistakably sets the boundary for their unrequisite love for one another .",pos
4,cv490,17872,16,"ditto for another scene in which reza gives leila a large stuffed animal for her birthday , and then reveals a beautiful necklace he has also gotten her .",pos
4,cv490,17872,17,"these "" small "" moments are the perfect contrast for the solemn , outraging sequences in the latter half , in which reza drops leila off at the side of a busy road , and then zooms off to go on a date with another woman .",pos

4,cv490,17872,19,"refusing to stay over at her parent's house , the film inevitably leads up to the second wedding night between reza and another woman , and in a sequence of extraordinary sorrow and potency , leila finds her whole being emotionally torn apart , as she is closed up in an upstairs bedroom as the marriage proceedings are going on down below .",pos
4,cv490,17872,20,"despite her initial agreement to such a thing , leila realizes how much she has been betrayed by reza , whom she believed cared for her as much as she did of him .",pos
4,cv490,17872,21,"sure , the whole second marriage was his mother's idea , but if he really did believe what he initially had told her about not wanting any children , then he could have still easily backed out , couldn't he ?",pos
4,cv490,17872,22,"in the pivotal role of leila , who appears in every scene , leila hatami is nothing short of remarkable , injecting her character with an equal measure of startling strength , unavoidable vulnerability , and utter despair .",pos
4,cv490,17872,23,"unlike most american films , in which everything always has to be spelled out for audiences , hatami says much more with just an elusive expression on her face than could possibly have been conveyed by words .",pos
4,cv490,17872,24,"every bit a perfect match for hatami is ali mosaffa , as reza , a man who , i believe , does hold an unbreakable bond with his wife , but is too naive to realize what he will be doing to leila if he marries someone else .",pos
4,cv490,17872,25,"for all of its strong aspects , "" leila "" isn't a perfect film .",pos
4,cv490,17872,26,"on a technical level , i found many blatant punctiation and spelling mistakes within the subtitles that need to be fixed .",pos

4,cv492,18271,7,what is new is the ability to weave all of these various elements together and succeed in producing a film that is both entertaining as well as thought-provoking .,pos

4,cv492,18271,14,the film turns our very perception of life on its side .,pos

4,cv492,18271,18,"reeves , whom i've never really cared for as an actor , is competent in roles which require a lot of straightforwardness , and little subtlety .",pos
4,cv492,18271,19,"he was good in speed , for example , but laughably poor in a walk in the clouds .",pos
4,cv492,18271,20,"neo is actually one of those roles which reeves slips into rather nicely , so much of my expectation was happily for naught .",pos
4,cv492,18271,21,"in a couple of places , the script even capitalizes upon his wooden nature , and this is a heavy credit to writers/directors andy and larry wachowski .",pos

4,cv492,18271,32,"many methods of imagery are employed , from modeling to bluescreen to computer graphics .",pos
4,cv492,18271,33,"of special note is the use of the "" freeze and turn "" effect where the entire scene is frozen , turned , then continued from a new angle .",pos
4,cv492,18271,34,"this is accomplished by using a large number of still cameras employed in a semi-circle , with motion picture cameras placed at the two ends .",pos

4,cv492,18271,40,"much of it seems like the combination of two genres of the hong kong action film - there's a lot of kung fu , there's a lot of gunplay .",pos
4,cv492,18271,41,"when a character is letting go with an automatic weapon , much is made of the empty cartridges falling to the floor in slow motion .",pos
4,cv492,18271,42,"there's also the element of the japanese action cartoon ( called anime by aficionados ) , especially in the way the sequences are filmed in sweeping pans and emphasized actions through special effects .",pos
4,cv492,18271,43,"combined , it's really like no live-action film i have ever seen .",pos
4,cv492,18271,44,the film is not without its faults .,pos

4,cv497,26980,3,"the film takes place in harrisburg , pa in 1988 during an unseasonably warm winter .",pos

4,cv497,26980,22,i have to admit i was honestly surprised and pleased by how the plot unraveled and the methods each of the main characters use to try to get their share of the money .,pos
4,cv497,26980,23,"like "" jackie brown , "" ( an elmore leonard adaption ) , the story is about a circle of 10 characters all after the lottery money that has been won illegally .",pos
4,cv497,26980,24,the screenplay does a fine job in balancing the characters and slowly revealing their motivations and hidden agendas while at the same time keep russ richards the main focus .,pos

5,cv501,11657,23,wrong .,pos
5,cv501,11657,24,"while you may be expecting one thing to happen , it certainly doesn't turn out that way .",pos
5,cv501,11657,25,"the film begins in a classroom , with nearly all the main characters present .",pos
5,cv501,11657,26,"there's sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a counselor for the students .",pos

5,cv501,11657,34,one student responds .,pos
5,cv501,11657,35,this pretty much sets the tone of the film we are about to watch .,pos
5,cv501,11657,36,"however , upon hearing this , one student , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , stands up and leaves the room , commenting that they can both kiss part of her body .",pos
5,cv501,11657,37,"and so , wild things sets into motion .",pos
5,cv501,11657,38,"quickly , kelly begins hitting on sam , but sam doesn't want anything to do with her advances .",pos
5,cv501,11657,39,kelly is stubborn and continues to pursue him .,pos

5,cv501,11657,41,"surprisingly , that's really all i can tell you about the plot .",pos
5,cv501,11657,42,any more would give away one of the many crucial plot twists .,pos
5,cv501,11657,43,"and what's more , these plot twists are actually unpredictable .",pos
5,cv501,11657,44,"going along the way of scream , wild things maintains that film's surprises , and then adds even more to them .",pos
5,cv501,11657,45,there are more plot twists in this film than probably any i have ever seen .,pos
5,cv501,11657,46,"and even though you think you may get tired of them , the surprises are so genuine that it's rather pleasing .",pos
5,cv501,11657,47,"going back over them in my mind , nearly all of them work , though some stretch the boundaries of belief .",pos
5,cv501,11657,48,"thankfully , the convoluted plot doesn't give us much time to think about each one , pouncing yet another twist on us before the shock of the previous one has worn off .",pos
5,cv501,11657,49,"as for the critics who complain that the film is trashy--well , it is .",pos
5,cv501,11657,50,this is pretty much just one trashy film .,pos
5,cv501,11657,51,"however , it is the kind of trashy that isn't hard to watch .",pos
5,cv501,11657,52,"it's good trash , in a sense .",pos
5,cv501,11657,53,"one , the screenplay knows that it's not to be taken seriously , and it includes a lot of humor and satire into the story .",pos
5,cv501,11657,54,"this varies everywhere from kelly's mother ( theresa russell ) , who is more of a caricature of rich people , all the way to an ambulance-chasing lawyer ( bill murray ) , who wears a neck-brace to cover an insurance scam he is running .",pos
5,cv501,11657,55,"bill murray also provides the best character in the film , and most of the genuine laughs .",pos
5,cv501,11657,56,"and two , the sex is more than gratuitous , although not unwelcomed .",pos
5,cv501,11657,57,"wild things is supposed to have sex in it ( what film with that title wouldn't ? ) , and this movie breaks the boundaries .",pos
5,cv501,11657,58,"instead of having heterosexual sex scenes , it also includes lesbian scenes between denise richards and neve campbell ( don't worry . . .",pos
5,cv501,11657,59,it's not as graphic as you might think ) .,pos
5,cv501,11657,60,"the heterosexual scenes are quite graphic , but the surprise shocker is kevin bacon's full-frontal nude scene .",pos
5,cv501,11657,61,"it's very brief , so if you blink , you may miss ( ahem ) it .",pos
5,cv501,11657,62,"and , for as long as i can remember , i don't think i have seen an r-rated film show an erect one before ( it's not completely , but judging from the audiences' reaction , it was more than they expected too ) .",pos
5,cv501,11657,63,"also , during one scene late in the film , there seemed to be a relationship brewing between bacon and dillon's characters , but nothing came of it ( makes you wonder if the director had to cut it in order for the r rating , or if the actors refused to do it ) .",pos
5,cv501,11657,64,what first made me want to see wild things was its cast .,pos
5,cv501,11657,65,"neve campbell , of course , has been one of my favorite actresses since the scream films were released .",pos
5,cv501,11657,66,"here , however , she turns every typical role she has done on its head and plays a gothic pothead .",pos
5,cv501,11657,67,the closest role to this was her performance in the craft ( though even in that she was a nice girl ) .,pos
5,cv501,11657,68,campbell is probably the best in the film and shows her wide range of talent .,pos
5,cv501,11657,69,you can tell she will be around for a long time .,pos
5,cv501,11657,70,"denise richards will also be around for a long time , although she may be limited to the roles without much range .",pos
5,cv501,11657,71,"here , she gets to express more emotions than in her stiff ( yet effective ) performance in starship troopers .",pos
5,cv501,11657,72,hopefully one day she will land a very good role that can display her ability .,pos
5,cv501,11657,73,"and then there is daphne rubin-vega , a newcomer to the movies .",pos
5,cv501,11657,74,"she gives a very good performance , although her character is mostly left to the background for the first hour and a half .",pos
5,cv501,11657,75,towards the end she does get a bigger part .,pos
5,cv501,11657,76,"on the male side , matt dillon is probably the best , giving a subtle performance that surprises with every twist .",pos
5,cv501,11657,77,"kevin bacon has a slightly wooden character , but he makes the most of it .",pos
5,cv501,11657,78,"you must have admiration , though , for what he did on screen .",pos
5,cv501,11657,79,"and judging from many of the women's reactions in the theater to that shot , they have grown a deeper appreciation for bacon ( yeah , right ) .",pos
5,cv501,11657,80,and then there is bill murray .,pos
5,cv501,11657,81,"his performance is the comic relief , and he nearly steals the film .",pos
5,cv501,11657,82,"as a whole , the entire cast works wondrously together , and they seem at home , even when doing the menage a troi .",pos
5,cv501,11657,83,"director john mcnaughton , who has previously done the critically acclaimed henry : portrait of a serial killer , has constructed a wonderfully twisty plot that works .",pos
5,cv501,11657,84,his direction is smooth and stylish .,pos
5,cv501,11657,85,"the visuals are striking , filled with rich colors , and almost so realistic that we can actually breathe the humidity in the air .",pos
5,cv501,11657,86,"however , he seems more at home when the actors aren't talking .",pos
5,cv501,11657,87,"his fly-by shots of the swampy areas are brilliant , and his photography of denise richards' climbing out of the pool is a highlight .",pos
5,cv501,11657,88,"the cinematography is gorgeous in its details . its not often that you see a film like this , and we should watch it just to see how the camera can take pictures .",pos
5,cv501,11657,89,"then , there is the music .",pos
5,cv501,11657,90,"this was probably the most obvious thing to me , as it set the perfect mood for the film .",pos
5,cv501,11657,91,"it's hard to describe in words , so just see the film and listen to it .",pos
5,cv501,11657,92,it's wonderfully composed and presented .,pos
5,cv501,11657,93,and be sure to stick around during the closing credits !,pos
5,cv501,11657,94,mcnaughton has finally put the ending credits to good use ( while most comedies use it for outtakes ) .,pos
5,cv501,11657,95,he has included some small scenes which help explain the preceding events .,pos
5,cv501,11657,96,"some may say that these are lame attempts to explain the convoluted plot , but it's an entertaining way to finish the film .",pos
5,cv501,11657,97,"plus , there are some shocking moments in these ending credits which just add to the fun .",pos
5,cv501,11657,98,"wild things is appropriately rated r for strong sexuality , nudity , language and violence .",pos
5,cv501,11657,99,"again , the nudity is rather unnecessary , but let's face it--people want to see it .",pos
5,cv501,11657,100,so why not give it to them ?,pos
5,cv501,11657,101,"neve campbell , admirably , has a no-nudity clause in her contract , and the most you see of her is from behind as she takes her top off ( way to go , neve ! ) .",pos
5,cv501,11657,102,"the sex scenes are graphic , especially the first one we see , between the mother and one of her deck hands .",pos
5,cv501,11657,103,one almost wonders how they got away with the r rating .,pos
5,cv501,11657,104,"the language is quite harsh too , ranging from sexual innuendo to your average , everyday profanity .",pos
5,cv501,11657,105,and i can't stress it enough : don't allow kids under 18 to see this film .,pos
5,cv501,11657,106,"the target age for the movie is the 18-24 range , and that's who should see it .",pos
5,cv501,11657,107,it's definitely not for those under 18 !,pos
5,cv501,11657,108,"did i mention that this film is rated r ? however , for those that do get a chance to watch it , you will probably more likely be pleased , and may even take friends to see it the next time .",pos

5,cv503,10558,25,"i liked the relationship between some of the people , like will and skylar , will and sean , sean and lambeau , and will and his friends .",pos
5,cv503,10558,26,there are scenes between them which are just amazing to watch .,pos
5,cv503,10558,27,"and there are even moments in the film which are so honest in their portrayal , that i felt rightfully uncomfortable .",pos
5,cv503,10558,28,"like the break-up scene between will and skylar , will and sean's first meeting , a bar scene between sean and lambeau , and a scene where sean tells in detail how he doesn't regret meeting his first wife , who would later suffer a slow , painful death , and leave him lonely and slightly bitter .",pos
5,cv503,10558,29,"however , the main flaw of the film is there's too much of everything , and not enough of it either .",pos
5,cv503,10558,30,"the film tries for deeper relations between the characters , but they're sometimes either overwritten or underwritten .",pos
5,cv503,10558,31,"take for example the relationship between sean and will : the film gets an interesting father/son as well as doctor/patient relationship going with out any problems , but when it tries to show them as equals , it falls on its face .",pos

5,cv503,10558,34,"also , will's relationship with his best friend , chuckie ( affleck ) , has a nice climax , but not enough rising action .",pos
5,cv503,10558,35,"we see them joking around , but when chuckie arrives at a decision between the two of them , it seems more like a superficial reasoning than a more selected one .",pos
5,cv503,10558,36,"their relationship never goes beyond "" just best friends , "" and his decision just seems to be a generalization of any two best friends instead of something more . . . human .",pos
5,cv503,10558,37,maybe it was just me .,pos
5,cv503,10558,38,"and it also goes for a parallelism with the relationship between sean and lambeau , but that , again , is underwritten .",pos
5,cv503,10558,39,"and , of course , as in most films like this , the girl/boy relationship is pretty underwritten .",pos
5,cv503,10558,40,"we never understand what they see in each other , so when skylar confesses that she loves him , it seems more like it's there for plot details that anything else .",pos
5,cv503,10558,41,"minnie driver is interesting , though , and breathes life into her character .",pos
5,cv503,10558,42,"the writing is a bit at fault here , but what makes all this worthwhile is the little moments in the film where it acheives true awesomeness .",pos
5,cv503,10558,43,"sure , it feels overstuffed , but it's extremely enjoyable .",pos

5,cv506,15956,5,"i've seen this "" lolita "" twice : the first time , i wasn't so blown away .",pos

5,cv506,15956,9,the story of a pedophile obsessed with a young 14-year old girl named dolores a . k . a . lolita is great because it's not trash for the perverted but because it's about human obsession with things that are out of one's reach .,pos
5,cv506,15956,10,"its protagonist , the comically-named humbert humbert , is not your average pedophile , but a seriously wounded human being who embodies how we are all destroyed by our sick obsessions and idosyncrasies .",pos

5,cv506,15956,13,"the focus of this film , and the reason for making it , it seems , was to really penetrate the emotional depths of the novel and bring them to life on the screen in beautifully dramatic images , and scenes which are blatantly over-stylized .",pos
5,cv506,15956,14,"the tone of the book is a comical one , but it's also a tragic one , and humbert , telling the story from his perspective , blows every single thing out of perspective .",pos

5,cv506,15956,16,we get a sense that perhaps it's by doing this that humbert has really trapped himself into a fate that will ultimately leave him haggard and destroyed .,pos
5,cv506,15956,17,"he weeps uncontrollably and never lets himself get over his original 14-year-old love , and allows himself to embody her as lolita .",pos

5,cv506,15956,22,"this is the second time the novel has been adapted for the screen , the first time being filmed in - shock - 1962 , by stanley kubrick , who couldn't possibly have brought the novel to the screen with as much faithfulness as lyne has been able to do , but did the next best thing : he economized for everything and came up with a droll black comedy about obsession in general .",pos
5,cv506,15956,23,"in that film , he used the traps of society as benefits .",pos
5,cv506,15956,24,"the studio demanded the final scene , that of a heinous murder , come first in the film so to portray humbert first as a murderer and second as a pedophile . . . and",pos

5,cv506,15956,26,"the censors wouldn't allow anymore than a couple glances and subtle dialogue to show the , um , relationship between humbert and lolita , so kubrick decided to play it as comedy , but still allow the tragedy to seep through .",pos
5,cv506,15956,27,"looking at these two versions , especially after reading the novel ( and we all know that when we've read a novel and see a film adaptation , we are bound to be angered by any size differences ) , it's really impossible to compare them .",pos
5,cv506,15956,28,"they both go for different things , and one has a lot more room to be as sexually frank as the novel was .",pos
5,cv506,15956,29,"and although it's true that several scenes are similar , and are thus up for comparison , overall it's unfair to say which one is better and which one is worse .",pos

5,cv506,15956,34,"jeremy irons , with his deep , soft british voice and gentle look , is an amazing humbert .",pos
5,cv506,15956,35,"he's droll in a very unique way , and , well , no one can look distraught the way he does .",pos
5,cv506,15956,36,he brings a wonderful sympathy to the role that goes beyond pathos and really comes up as being easy to identify with the audience .,pos
5,cv506,15956,37,"and when he looks at lolita with love , and she looks at him with lust , you know that he's her prisoner for as long as he lives .",pos
5,cv506,15956,38,"and dominique swain , who plays the title character , is rather incredible .",pos
5,cv506,15956,39,"she pulls off the tough role even better than sue lyon did in the original , wonderfully balancing the qualities of seduction , bratiness , and self-centeredness that marks the character .",pos
5,cv506,15956,40,"it's easy to see why she surrenders to humbert : she loves the attention , and knows that she can have her way with him at any time .",pos
5,cv506,15956,41,"when he denies her something , she blackmails him effortlessly ( a scene involving a rocking chair and a little foot action is damn near classic ) , and when he stands up to her , she weeps and runs away , leaving humbert to follow her .",pos
5,cv506,15956,42,"there are two other minor characters in the film , one who's a road block in the beginning , and the other who's a reappearing threat to the relationship .",pos
5,cv506,15956,43,"the former is charlotte , lolita's mother , played by melanie griffith .",pos
5,cv506,15956,44,"in the book , charlotte is a monster of a woman : overbearing , constantly scolding her child , overly-religious , and ultimately selfish .",pos
5,cv506,15956,45,"and she's the one obstacle humbert has to overcome to obtain his goal , at least in the beginning .",pos
5,cv506,15956,46,"as played by shelly winters in the original , she represented all these qualities ; as played by griffith here , she's about half of them .",pos
5,cv506,15956,47,it's annoying to watch a film and play a game where you try to see who could have done the role way better than the one on screen without mentioning the actor who played them first .,pos
5,cv506,15956,48,"and even though griffith is not really bad , persay , she's nothing more .",pos

5,cv506,15956,53,"as you can see , most of these are not improvements or mistakes done on the part of lyne and his screenwriter , stephen schiff , but just parts of a whole new look at the novel , at least cinema-wise .",pos

5,cv506,15956,55,"the camera movements are stylized , and each shot is breathtakingly rich .",pos
5,cv506,15956,56,"the acting is for the most part wonderful , and when we watch it , we really get a sense that for humbert , who is telling the story , the only two people on earth most of the time were humbert and lolita .",pos
5,cv506,15956,57,"more importantly , it takes us right up the brink of emotion , then jumps right over it .",pos
5,cv506,15956,58,"by the end , with humbert sadly driving recklessly in his car , following what he says is the only part of his life he doesn't regret , we feel that we all lose to something we can never have .",pos

5,cv507,9220,7,"this is one of the few movies i've seen where i was laughing consistently almost all the way through : instead of a couple of set-pieces that inspired a laugh ( think of the dismal fatal instinct ) , the whole movie works like clockwork .",pos

5,cv507,9220,22,he uses it to great effect in this movie .,pos

5,cv507,9220,24,"he can't even write the lie ; his fingers twitch , his body buckles like someone in the throes of cyanide poisoning , and when he tries to talk it's like he's speaking in tongues .",pos
5,cv507,9220,25,"equally funny is a scene where he beats himself to a pulp ( don't ask why ) , tries to drink water to keep from having outbursts in the courtroom ( it fails , with semi-predictable results ) , and winds up biting the bullet when he gets called into the boardroom to have everyone ask what they think of them .",pos

5,cv508,16006,0,"maybe the most important thing about this movie is that it's not handled like the hallmark hall of fame movie of the month , because it very well could have been a manipulative tearjerker , broadcasted on abc on a monday night , starring kelly martin and yasmeen bleeth , respectively .",pos

5,cv508,16006,4,it goes from character to character .,pos
5,cv508,16006,5,"it obsesses itself with the depth and the style of it all , and makes the story of a world-reknowned cellist who contracts ms and dies prematurely into the story of two sisters , both musicians , who have a totally unique relationship .",pos
5,cv508,16006,6,"it's that their relationship is the center of the story that makes this film transcend any cornball , shamelessly tired tearjerker qualities it could have had and makes this , unlike "" patch adams , "" effortlessly emotional and real .",pos
5,cv508,16006,7,"in short , this movie is just awesome .",pos
5,cv508,16006,8,"it merely tells its story really well , and that's something that just has to be commended these days , when most stories are botched because they're not told by great storytellers .",pos
5,cv508,16006,9,director anand tucker tells this story well .,pos
5,cv508,16006,10,"he overdramaticizes everything , but still keeps it real .",pos
5,cv508,16006,11,"the film tells the story of hilary and jacqueline du pr ? ( rachel griffiths and emily watson , respectively ) , two sisters who are first seen in childhood ( played by auriol evans and keely flanders , respectively ) as the very best of friends .",pos
5,cv508,16006,12,"they are also both musicians , hilary a flutist and jackie a cellist , and when it all begins , both are considered child prodigies , but hilary is seen as the better of the two .",pos

5,cv508,16006,14,"when they both hit adulthood , hilary strives for a comeback , while her sister is playing in famous halls around the world , but instead of fame , captures the heart of a hapless , joyful conductor , kiffer finzi ( david morissey , in a semi-star-making turn ) .",pos
5,cv508,16006,15,"they marry , after a short courtship , and move to a lovely country house , making jackie incredibly jealous since her cello playing becomes a symbol of her current life : when she plays , she has the eyes of the world , but when she stops , she's alone .",pos
5,cv508,16006,16,"she enters into a shallow relationship with an equally famous pianist , daniel barenboim ( james frain ) , in hopes that she may overcloud her sister , but she eventually begins to lose it , and runs away to hilary's country home , where she hopes to gain admittance by hilary to sleep with her husband , since no one she sleeps with gives her any pleasure .",pos
5,cv508,16006,17,"it's all terribly melodramtic , as you can see , and by the time jackie has contracted ms ( in a brilliantly edited scene that surpasses the breakdown scene in the semi-smiliar "" shine "" in technical and emotional devastation ) , it would have been the time that i could easily call the sign for melodramatic overload if it hadn't been handled in such a way .",pos
5,cv508,16006,18,"the key thing here is that it's not about her gradual death and slip into insanity but rather that it's about her tumultuous relationship with her sister , which , i might add , is perfectly realized .",pos
5,cv508,16006,19,"their relationship is the most down-to-earth complex entity of the year : they love eachother more than anyone else in the entire world , but they're also completely jealous of one another .",pos
5,cv508,16006,20,"when a young jackie surpasses her playing abilities , she tries in vain to make a comeback but can't , and almost seems to marry to get back at jackie for her success .",pos
5,cv508,16006,21,"when jackie lands on top and sees her sister marry a wonderful man , she is jealous of her lifestyle to the most extensive brinks that i've ever seen in a film ( only two sisters who truly love eachother would dare share the same man ) .",pos
5,cv508,16006,22,"and the whole time , their love for eachother is never doubted or even tested .",pos
5,cv508,16006,23,another thing i really liked is emily watson's performance .,pos
5,cv508,16006,24,i usually make it a note to never overpraise an actor for playing either a drunkard or a lunatic or someone with a mortal disease ( or any combination of the three ) .,pos
5,cv508,16006,25,my reasoning for this is that it's a fucking easy job .,pos
5,cv508,16006,26,"the worst case for this very year may be thandie newton in "" beloved "" : sure , she's good , but what's so tough about playing a woman who stumbles around , slurs her words together , and acts like a three year old inside a 20-year old's body ?",pos
5,cv508,16006,27,"hell , i could play that if i had a pair of breasts .",pos
5,cv508,16006,28,"in that same exact movie , though , is a performance by kimberly elise where she has to be the rock that holds the family together as her mother slowly goes insane , her brothers run off never to be seen again , and her mother's lover is scared off .",pos
5,cv508,16006,29,"she has to actually deal with real emotions , something much harder than mere stumbling about .",pos
5,cv508,16006,30,but the academy of arts and sciences loves loves loves overpraising performances like newtons .,pos
5,cv508,16006,31,"if you don't believe me , look at jack nicholson's performance in "" as good as it gets "" : great performance , but easy job .",pos
5,cv508,16006,32,"this isn't so for watson , though , because her insanity comes from real emotions , not just a plot point .",pos
5,cv508,16006,33,"and thanks to the opening sequence , where we see her and hilary as kids , we understand the motives behind all her actions , and by the time she actually contracts ms and begins to loose her sanity and her life , we've already understood that this is the last straw for a woman plagued with terrible neuroses .",pos
5,cv508,16006,34,"rachel griffiths , who would have otherwise been the understudy to watson's protagonist , actually matches watson step-for-step , because as watson grows insane , and demands unspeakable things from her , griffiths holds her own , and has to deal with what she is able to give her sister who needs emotional help from her .",pos
5,cv508,16006,35,"griffiths , an otherwise unknown actress ( and watson being famous from "" breaking the waves "" and "" the boxer "" ) , is absolutely brilliant , just as absolutely brilliant as watson is , and if the academy and all the other critics groups , who've already deemed watson's performance the best of the year , glance over hers because she's the one who doesn't get to go insane ( read : she gets the boring role ) , then the scream of hysteria you hear will be from me .",pos
5,cv508,16006,36,"after all , griffiths has the thankless job of keeping things real - the tom cruise role in "" rainman "" ( the one who should have gotten oscar consideration and not hoffman ) .",pos
5,cv508,16006,37,"she does , and if anyone deserves accolades from the academy this year , it's griffiths .",pos
5,cv508,16006,38,"together , the two actresses work extremely well , though , and both have to go through deep emotional hell , the likes of which haven't been seen this year .",pos
5,cv508,16006,39,"if it hadn't been for an otherwise not-totally-great final section that deals way too much with jackie and not enough with hilary ( when the two had gotten equal treatment for the entirety ) , i'd say this is one of the top ten best films of the year .",pos
5,cv508,16006,40,"it's so close to perfection , in its structure , its treatment of its subject , and its beautiful technical specifications ( cinematography nomination , without a shred of doubt in my mind , and maybe film editing ) , that it's nearly a shame that it's not the flawless gem that it should be .",pos
5,cv508,16006,41,"but , hey , as it is , i can hardly complain .",pos

5,cv509,15888,29,"hmm . well , the movie goes through twists and turns , having some sad moments and happy ones , until at one moment tom hanks and meg ryan "" hook up "" , to use modern terminology , and kiss their way into happiness .",pos

5,cv511,10132,4,""" alien : resurrection "" leaves off 200 years after the last one , where our heroine protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , the science fiction genre's answer to job , had killed herself after discovering that an alien was inside her body , waiting to pop out like it did to john hurt in the first one .",pos
5,cv511,10132,5,"of course , the last one wasn't very great or anything ( i liked it , though not as much as the first two ) , and more importantly , it wasn't financially successful ( a tawdry 55 million bucks ! ) .",pos
5,cv511,10132,6,"so back we are , with ripley back as a clone , which means we get another little satirical look at cloning ( not that that's a bad thing , but it's becoming a cliche ) .",pos
5,cv511,10132,7,"so she's cloned aboard an even more futuristic-looking ship called "" the auriga "" by some doctors ( including the necessary bad government guy , dr . wren , played by j . e . freeman , as well as the little-seen dr . gediman , played by none other than brad douriff ) , mainly because they have a version of her with the alien still inside her .",pos
5,cv511,10132,8,"once you get past the fact that you can't figure out where they got her blood ( although i think it might have been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one ) , the film's okay .",pos
5,cv511,10132,9,"also on board are a band of mercenary pirates , including michael wincott , ron perlman , kim flowers , raymond cruz , dominique pinon ( a jeunet sytable ) and . . . winona ryder , who plays analee call , who turns out to have a bit of a secret ( i won't state it , but unless you've been shacking up with salinger for the past two years , you probably know all about it - although it's nicely covered up ) .",pos
5,cv511,10132,10,"there's a bit of a non-sexual-yet-slightly-homoerotic relationship between her and ripley , but it's never really deepened enough .",pos
5,cv511,10132,11,oh well .,pos
5,cv511,10132,12,"well , as you might have guessed , the alien and its spawn escape and run around the ship .",pos
5,cv511,10132,13,"and it pretty much does away with most of the people on the ship ( including some shocks - dan hedaya , for instance , who's death is comical yet sad since , well , he's dan hedaya ) , and the remaining people ( about 7 or 8 ) are left to try and escape and stop the aliens from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly towards earth .",pos
5,cv511,10132,14,"of course , the plot is all balderdash , and just an excuse for some good old "" alien "" -brand fun .",pos
5,cv511,10132,15,"the real focus of the series seems to be on style , not really substance ( although there's always a bit of it , most notably in "" aliens "" with the relationship between ripley and the little girl ) .",pos
5,cv511,10132,16,what's interesting about the series is that each film is stylistically different in its approach .,pos
5,cv511,10132,17,""" alien "" is a claustrophobic exercise in quiet frights .",pos
5,cv511,10132,18,""" aliens "" is a wild , tense thriller .",pos
5,cv511,10132,19,""" alien 3 "" is a bleak , moody piece of semi-noir .",pos
5,cv511,10132,20,""" alien 4 "" is kind of like an off-beat french film , filled with lots of humor , and cool scares .",pos
5,cv511,10132,21,"jean-pierre jeunet ( without his usual directing partner , marc caro ) creates a ship filled with the kind of scares films like "" das boot "" has , with echoes hinting at a possible threat .",pos
5,cv511,10132,22,"the chills in the film are really cool , especially with the music , which is sometimes turned down completely for certain scenes ( there's the most tense surgery scene since "" face/off "" towards the beginning ) .",pos
5,cv511,10132,23,and not every chill turns into a bloody mess or anything like that .,pos
5,cv511,10132,24,this all combined with some good old humor makes this as interesting visually and stylistically as the others .,pos
5,cv511,10132,25,there are even a couple scenes which just stick out afterwards as being brilliantly executed .,pos
5,cv511,10132,26,one is the aforementioned surgery scene .,pos
5,cv511,10132,27,"another one takes place between call and ripley , which is just awesome .",pos
5,cv511,10132,28,"the underwater chase scene and the ladder scene afterwards is one of the most tense , thrilling , and jaw-dropping scenes in the entire saga ( with a small allusion to jeunet's earlier film , "" delicatessen "" ) .",pos
5,cv511,10132,29,"and the way they do in the final alien is hysterically cool ( with a lovely allusion to "" goldfinger "" ) .",pos
5,cv511,10132,30,"but the best scene in the entire film ( i'm sure i'm not the first to mention it ) takes place when ripley sees all the variations on her as they cloned her ( she has a an "" 8 "" tatooed on her arm ) .",pos
5,cv511,10132,31,it might be the most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga .,pos
5,cv511,10132,32,"the screenplay by joss whedon is not a great piece of work , as it never really deapens a lot of the characters .",pos
5,cv511,10132,33,"however , it does make us care about most of them , so that when there's very little of them , and it looks like one or more of them may become alien chow , we are pretty scared .",pos
5,cv511,10132,34,"and , yeah , there are some very funny lines ( ripley : "" who do i have to fuck to get off this boat ? ! """,pos
5,cv511,10132,35,"johner : "" well , i can get you off .",pos
5,cv511,10132,36,"but not this ship . "" )",pos
5,cv511,10132,37,"the acting is good all around , with stand-out performances from ron perlman as the male chauvenist pig johner , and leland orser ( the poor bastad in "" se7en "" who performed the "" lust "" sin ) as an anxiety-ridden wannabe woody allen who has an alien inside him .",pos
5,cv511,10132,38,"winona ryder is good , but not amazing like she usually is ( although she meshes well with the film ) .",pos
5,cv511,10132,39,"of course , and as usual , sigourney weaver steals the show .",pos
5,cv511,10132,40,"playing a variation on the ripley character ( less emotional , and more rude and bitter ) , she pulls it off while still being utterly lovable .",pos
5,cv511,10132,41,"she's not going to get an oscar nomination like she did for "" aliens , "" but she's just awesome .",pos
5,cv511,10132,42,"overall , it's a thrilling , entertaining film which doesn't really amaze like the first two , but is much more amazing than the third installment .",pos
5,cv511,10132,43,"the style is the best part of the film , which isn't really a bad thing , but it being the best part takes away from a lot of the depth the film occasionally tries to apply .",pos
5,cv511,10132,44,"but it's entertaining as hell , and it's definitely fit for the "" alien "" series .",pos
5,cv512,15965,0,"it may seem weird to begin a film about glam rock with a sequence that includes a spaceship , a green ovular pin , and the birth of oscar wilde , but if one really strains , they can see that perhaps maybe these connections are not half off .",pos
5,cv512,15965,1,"wilde's philosophy was that everyone should be true to their own human nature , and the result of his following this philosophy was that he was imprisoned , loosing his family and his career .",pos
5,cv512,15965,2,the glam rock movement in the early 70s in england had a similar take and came to a similar demise .,pos
5,cv512,15965,3,"the main difference was by placing makeup on their face and acting out on their deepest fantasies and inquiries about life ( mostly dealing with androgony and sexuality ) , they became less and less like themselves and more and more like everyone else .",pos
5,cv512,15965,4,and that's why the movement seemed to end as soon as it began .,pos
5,cv512,15965,5,"it's been said that todd haynes' "" velvet goldmine , "" the film that chronicles what it was like to be a part of the movement , not only from those who experienced it but by those who created it , steals a lot from "" citizen kane , "" and that's true .",pos
5,cv512,15965,6,"in the film , a british journalist in the 80s , arthur stuart ( christian bale ) , is asked to go back and find out what happened to 70s glam rock star brian slade , a fictitious rock star , who faked his own death on stage , bringing the end not only to his career but to the entire glam rock movement .",pos
5,cv512,15965,7,"structure-wise , this totally steals from "" kane , "" not only from the set-up ( he interviews three people , and the story is a result of their flashbacks ) , but in other things , like the beginning ( death , then newsreel ) , and smaller details , like the bitter ex-friend in a wheelchair and the bitter ex-wife as a washed-up lounge singer , found in a bar after hours .",pos
5,cv512,15965,8,"this is no "" kane , "" and it really doesn't aspire to be : it doesn't attempt to be the deep outlook of something gone like "" kane "" did , and it doesn't really uncover anything poignant about humanity .",pos
5,cv512,15965,9,"instead , it uses the flashbacks as a form of contrast between the magic that was the glam rock era and the boredom that was life after glam rock for those who were participants .",pos
5,cv512,15965,10,"the 80s scenes are dry and deliriously melancholy , equipped with a performance by bale that is perhaps appropriately dull and unengaging .",pos
5,cv512,15965,11,"but the 70s scenes are engaging , though , not to mention addictively campy .",pos
5,cv512,15965,12,"they radiate with gorgeous cinematography that nicely accentuates all the vibrant colors of the era , and a feel that's so eerily lighthearted that when combined with the then-footage , they become not only a symbol of decadence , but of times when everything seemed so simple .",pos
5,cv512,15965,13,"instead of creating the world the way it was , haynes paints their own world as if it were a narcotic fairy tale : the glam rock movement was full of so much freedom and liberation that after you've experienced it , everything else seems so mundane .",pos
5,cv512,15965,14,"there's no outside world to speak of , secluding these people inside a protective globe that will eventually crack .",pos
5,cv512,15965,15,"haynes focuses his story on the tale of blade and the other fictitious rock hero , curt wild , and their relationship that created , molded , and then brought down the movement , reducing everyone else who contributed to it as merely that - contributors .",pos
5,cv512,15965,16,"blade - played with reserve by the pouty jonathan rhys meyers - and wild - played with anarchic wildness by ewan mcgregor - are little more than thinly disguised recreations of david bowie and iggy pop , respectively , complete with the creation of a ziggy stardust persona named maxwell demon and the confirmation that the two rock stars may have very well not only have been one-time partners in music , but also partners in bed .",pos
5,cv512,15965,17,"through discussions with slade's ex-manager cecil ( michael feast ) , ex-wife mandy ( toni collette , reinventing herself as an american blonde dish who fakes a british accent when with slade ) , and finally ex-partner wild , journalist stuart begins to remember his own experiences in the era , like his discovery of his rebelliousness cum conformity , including the moment when he began questioning his own sexuality ( when he opens up his first slade record , he finds a naked and green slade lying on a crimson blanket ) , and finally running away from home to be part of the london scene , finally resulting in leading a boring job in america .",pos
5,cv512,15965,18,"haynes demonstrates that he's quite the visual auteur , molding scenes that are like long heald breaths , such as a seemingly long sequence juxtaposing a slade/wild concert of them performing a brian eno cover , "" baby's on fire , "" with scenes from a decadent drug party ; and the film's most wow-inspiring sequence , the first concert scene of wild with his band , the ratttz , where mcgregor lets loose so much anarchic steam that his wild iggy-esuqe movements ( including stripping naked ) and screams that the film captures that perfect moment when one discovers a major talent , and another ( slade ) discovers his idle .",pos
5,cv512,15965,19,"even the brief music videos , spoofs of bowie's , have a rare visual flair that's pure camp , and which would cause ken russell to drool .",pos
5,cv512,15965,20,"the best sequence , though , may be the beginning , following the prelude , a sequence which acts as the middle ground for both the actual being of the movement and the post-movement era .",pos
5,cv512,15965,21,"in it , stuart and his mates are going to the infamous slade concert where he fakes his own death , where he kills off his alter ego maxwell demon in what appears to be a real assasination , which brought about the end of the era in one swift fake bullet .",pos
5,cv512,15965,22,"with brian eno's famous "" needle in the camel's eye "" playing in the background , the scene has a detached exhileration - the song doesn't seem to be played in quite the same way the other songs are .",pos
5,cv512,15965,23,"it has a distance that's hard to put a finger on , and it seems to represent that all this is coming to a quick and sad ending , and when one sees slade in the dressing room before the show , docked in a silver frock with wings and blue hair , depressingly staring into the mirror , it comes off as a none-too-obvious prophecy of the finale in the beginning of the film .",pos
5,cv512,15965,24,"this movie's not so much about plot , but more about the way it is presented , making this one of those films which is classified as being "" style over substance , "" a statement which prompts many critics to line up for attack .",pos
5,cv512,15965,25,"however , for the most part , the engaging part of this film is not the story but rather the way in which haynes creates this world , by using his sets , costumes , cinematography , and especially the music to play as characters in his film .",pos
5,cv512,15965,26,the music is especially notable .,pos
5,cv512,15965,27,"the soundtrack , which is wall to wall , consists of old school glam rock tunes by the likes of brian eno , t-rex , and roxy music , as well as covers by slade's band ( with vocals by thom yorke , and occasionally rhys meyers himself ) , and even newer music by shudder to think that sounds uncannily bowie-like .",pos
5,cv512,15965,28,"the cast is rather impressive , but no one really walks away with the film , and no performances are extremely good .",pos
5,cv512,15965,29,"although eddie izzard , as slade's manager ( who challenges slade's first manager to an arm-wrestling match to see who gets control of his career ) and michael feast as the first and tragic manager come off greatly , and collette and mcgregor have their moments , rhys meyers and bale are noticably sub-par , neither putting a lot of effort into their respective roles .",pos
5,cv512,15965,30,some of it is at fault with the actual construction of the film by haynes .,pos
5,cv512,15965,31,"rhys meyers' brian slade remains merely a metaphor for the glam rock era , dying when he turned into a retro-garbo , resorting to a life of salinger-ism , and found in the mid-70s to be lying around , sniffing coke off the ass of a party girl .",pos
5,cv512,15965,32,"in fact , no one in this film is really seen as a person , rather than just as a symbol or composite of a type who thrived during the era .",pos
5,cv512,15965,33,"bale's character is an especially tough sell : bitter and depressed by flashbacks to his young adulthood , he's not an extremely personal character , and his cliched experiences ( being hounded by the record store guys for buying a record put out by a "" poof "" ) never help us communicate with him .",pos
5,cv512,15965,34,"nevertheless , rhys meyers and mcgregor have the excuses that their characters are not really characters but rather the results of an era that has left them , and others , bitter , part of which helps the film work , since this is a major piece of eye candy .",pos
5,cv512,15965,35,"at the prime of the movie , they at least look the role of fashionable leaders - slade with his perpetually-changing , androgonys persona , and wild with his topless and unpredictable image , which clash and fuse into an unstable union .",pos
5,cv512,15965,36,"their story - of how slade was so influenced by wild that he adapted it into a similar who-cares attitude crossed with camp - is engaging , without the personal background .",pos
5,cv512,15965,37,"the story of stuart , though , is a tougher sell because he's the everyman , and when you can't totally identify with the everyman , your story's in slight trouble .",pos
5,cv512,15965,38,"as a cultural rock piece , "" velvet goldmine "" is rather good , but it is merely good .",pos
5,cv512,15965,39,"it never totally takes off , although it has moments where it absolutely flies , but then comes back down .",pos
5,cv512,15965,40,"it's really nothing more than a bunch of really great moments , surrounded by material that could really be much better .",pos
5,cv512,15965,41,"the beginning is captivating but slow , the middle is fantastic , and the ending is not only shallow but worse than that , it drags ( the final half hour not only does it not bring the story to any real conclusion , it could probably stop at any point ) .",pos
5,cv512,15965,42,and did anyone really figure out what the mystery is that arthur unearths ?,pos
5,cv512,15965,43,"it almost seems like there was no point in the entire investigation other than to unearth the past , which is commendable but not totally so .",pos
5,cv512,15965,44,"still , it does what the oliver stone pic "" the doors "" didn't do right , becoming very insightful to what happened , using the visual style to hit most of the right notes of contrast between what made the era so great to those who lived during it and why after living through such an era that everything else seems half-assed ( i suppose the message is : "" live life , but after you've lived it , what else is the point when you'll be forced to live with regretful memories ? "" ) .",pos
5,cv512,15965,45,"the really superb achievement of this film is that during its flashbacks , it successfully creates for the audience what it must have felt like to be in that era , but with the added perk of knowing the result of all that goes down .",pos
5,cv513,6923,0,"when i first heard that romeo & juliet had been "" updated "" i shuddered .",pos
5,cv513,6923,1,i thought that yet another of shakespeare's classics had been destroyed .,pos

5,cv513,6923,3,"baz luhrman has directed an "" in your face "" , and visually stunning piece with this film .",pos
5,cv513,6923,4,"it revolves around the two rival families , who in this version each run multi-million dollar enterprises .",pos
5,cv513,6923,5,these rival companies/families are the capulet's and the montague's .,pos
5,cv513,6923,6,"the younger generation of these two families have formed gangs , who despise one another .",pos
5,cv513,6923,7,"as the storylines goes , romeo montague ( played by leonardo dicaprio ) and juliet capulet ( claire danes ) meet at a fancy dress party , and it is love at first site .",pos
5,cv513,6923,8,"i never believed love at first site was possible until i saw this film , the scene in which romeo's eyes meet juliet's through the fish tank is one of the most memorable .",pos
5,cv513,6923,9,"of course , they cannot publicly reveal their love , for their families are arch enemies .",pos
5,cv513,6923,10,"so they marry in secret , this is where things begin to go wrong .",pos
5,cv513,6923,11,"the story , as with all good shakespeare , ends in tragedy .",pos
5,cv513,6923,12,"the cinematography is spectacular to say the least , and the soundtrack provides the perfect atmosphere in which to "" lay our scene "" , as the film says .",pos
5,cv513,6923,13,there is very little to criticise .,pos
5,cv513,6923,14,"the performances are convincing , and several of the film's younger stars may find that it provides a launch for their careers .",pos
5,cv513,6923,15,the modernisation of the script is ingenious and clever .,pos
5,cv513,6923,16,"despite the well known storyline , this latest version still manages to cause tears among many members of the audience ( especially the younger generation ) , and this is certainly a great credit to the film .",pos

5,cv514,11187,8,"rather than break the news ( and face the consequences of misusing his funds ) , he invents a tribe : the shelmikedmu ( named after his kids ) .",pos
5,cv514,11187,9,"however , one lie begets another as he is not only required to deliver filmed proof of the shelmikedmu , but his research becomes a popular phenomenon .",pos
5,cv514,11187,10,"soon , professor krippendorf is caught up in an elaborate ruse in which he films mockumentary footage starring his children as the shelmikedmu tribal members .",pos
5,cv514,11187,11,"his efforts are hampered by the boasts of an over-eager colleague , veronica micelli ( jenna elfman ) , and the intense scrutiny of a rival anthropologist , ruth allen ( lily tomlin ) .",pos
5,cv514,11187,12,krippendorf's tribe does seem to require a little suspension of disbelief .,pos
5,cv514,11187,13,"no one seems to question the way his field documentaries seem to be shot with multiple cameras , or that his newly discovered tribesmen have startlingly blue eyes .",pos
5,cv514,11187,14,"luckily , as the film builds momentum , that suspension of disbelief is easy to come by .",pos
5,cv514,11187,15,"though there's some mild humor in the krippendorf family trying to pass themselves off as a lost tribe , the real humor of the film is in how james gets trapped in his ever increasing snowball of lies .",pos
5,cv514,11187,16,"the double meanings to many of the shelmikedmu appearances are enjoyable , and the comic timing required for some of the film's latter scenes is superb .",pos
5,cv514,11187,17,richard dreyfuss is terrific as the hapless professor who soon loses control of his own imaginary tribe .,pos
5,cv514,11187,18,"jenna elfman's position as a romantic lead seems a bit forced at times , but she plays the part with extreme affability .",pos

5,cv514,11187,20,"yes , the film does veer occasionally into some rather lowbrow humor , but it has the best excuse of all : it's funny .",pos
5,cv514,11187,21,"it may not go down as an all-time classic , but it certainly delivers what you expect from a comedy : plenty of laughs .",pos
5,cv515,17069,0,"not since 1996's shine , which starred geoffrey rush as pianist david helfgott , has a movie so defiantly laid bare the lives of world-class musicians .",pos
5,cv515,17069,1,"in fact , if one were to watch these films together , it would almost certainly stand as a convincing argument that a life of music naturally leads to all varieties of social ills .",pos
5,cv515,17069,2,"yet hilary and jackie , the sophomore effort from director anand tucker , has something more to say -- it softly but strongly explores the complex relationships of sibling rivalry and love in a very compelling tale .",pos

5,cv515,17069,4,"both musicians from childhood , hilary ( griffiths ) is renowned flutist while jacqueline ( watson ) is easily as skilled on the cello .",pos

5,cv515,17069,7,the performances of watson and griffiths are excellent in style and substance .,pos
5,cv515,17069,8,"they contrast each other wonderfully , and while watson's portrayal of jackie du pr ? is at times eccentric and perhaps unsympathetic , both characters are charged with emotion .",pos

5,cv515,17069,10,the script is also to be commended for its well-polished dual nature .,pos
5,cv515,17069,11,cottrell boyce adopts a style which one might expect to see in a mystery thriller ( which was in fact the case with david koepp and robert towne's script for mission : impossible ) and skillfully molds it to the story of two rising musicians on different courses to fame .,pos
5,cv515,17069,12,"the latter parts of his script are controversial to say the least , and the rather depressing ending takes the wind out of an envigorating story .",pos

5,cv519,14661,93,"the only real problem with the film , that i could see , was that it slows down considerably during the midsection , just after we have been immersed in the visuals and before the search for annie begins .",pos
5,cv519,14661,94,"by the way , some controversy even surrounded the title , which was mistaken for a sexual term ( "" what "" becomes "" wet "" and you should understand ) .",pos

5,cv519,14661,96,just thought i should let you know .,pos
5,cv520,12295,0,"when i was growing up in 1970s , boys in my school used to divide into two groups , based on their action movies preferences .",pos
5,cv520,12295,1,"the first one , myself included , liked movies that featured spectacular car chases , lots of machinegun fire and huge explosions .",pos
5,cv520,12295,2,"the latter one preferred hong kong martial arts flicks , probably because they could ( or , to be more precise , thought they could ) imitate its stunts in the real life .",pos
5,cv520,12295,3,"decades later , while refining my own cinematic taste , i began to appreciate and actually like those movies , probably because of overexposure to shoot-em-up idiocy of 1980s ramboids .",pos
5,cv520,12295,4,"yes , most of the kung fu and other "" martial arts "" flicks were cheap , they had predictable and formulaic plot , and asked very little of production values aside from martial arts skills .",pos
5,cv520,12295,5,"but , in the same time , those movies had their own rules and in the hands of capable director could become a terrific guilty pleasure and source of relaxation .",pos
5,cv520,12295,6,"the best of those movies , one that passed the test of time and managed to keep its own cult status after quarter of century was enter the dragon .",pos
5,cv520,12295,7,"made in 1973 in a joint hong kong - hollywood venture , it was intended to bring bruce lee's skills and kung fu philosophy to the western audience .",pos
5,cv520,12295,8,"it succeeded , but it is still debatable whether by its own merit or by the unfortunate and mysterious death of bruce lee that immortalised the myth about that actor .",pos
5,cv520,12295,9,lee plays a quiet shaolin monk who is a martial arts expert .,pos
5,cv520,12295,10,"he is approached by interpol official who asks him to join tri-annual martial arts tournament that is held on a remote island , owned and controlled by han , renegade shaolin monk .",pos
5,cv520,12295,11,"interpol suspects that the martial arts business is just cover for narcotics , gun-running and prostitution operations and lee must find the evidence necessary for authorities to intervene .",pos
5,cv520,12295,12,"lee accepts the mission because of personal reasons - o'harra , han's brutal bodyguard was responsible for the tragic death of lee's sister years ago .",pos
5,cv520,12295,13,"the island is also destination of two colourful martial arts experts from us - williams ( played by jim kelly ) is black activist running from the racist police , and his friend roper wants to make money in order to pay gambling debts .",pos
5,cv520,12295,14,the plot of enter the dragon was in many ways influenced by james bond ( the 007 franchise itself would return favour by using kung fu elements in the man with the golden gun two years later ) .,pos
5,cv520,12295,15,"the main hero was faced against a power-hungry megalomaniac on a remote island , alone against whole army of bad guys .",pos
5,cv520,12295,16,"on the other hand , lee was more believable hero than bond ; deprived of guns and super-tech gadgets , he had to rely only on his personal skills in order to survive .",pos
5,cv520,12295,17,"in the same time , the plot , although extremely thin , allowed him even some internal battles - between the natural instinct to avenge his sister and his own anti-violent philosophy .",pos
5,cv520,12295,18,the latter provided some opportunities to evaluate lee's acting skills and some new elements to his impressive screen presence .,pos
5,cv520,12295,19,"although two other main actors - john saxon being the obligatory good white guy and jim kelly being the obligatory black good guy - were intended to share top spot with lee , they served as nothing more than a comic relief .",pos
5,cv520,12295,20,"it is a real shame to see kelly , definitely the worse actor than saxon , to steal the scenes from him only because his lines , being the worst possible blaxploitation cliches , sound so damn over the top .",pos
5,cv520,12295,21,"other actors , not including shih kien who turns han into typical , although not very convincing bondian villain , are nothing more than fist fodder for bruce lee ( among them is young jackie chan ) .",pos
5,cv520,12295,22,"fighting scenes are still impressive today as they were 25 years ago , although they mostly lack gore associated with that genre .",pos
5,cv520,12295,23,"in many way they are also more realistic ( they were personally staged by lee himself ) , demanding only a blow or two to incapacitate or kill the opponent .",pos
5,cv520,12295,24,"i'm not a martial arts expert nor the martial arts fan , but comparing those scenes with typical scenes today i simply can't avoid to appreciate the difference from today's movie fights when masses of bloody pulp manage to get up from the floor and win in the end .",pos
5,cv520,12295,25,"so , despite all the obvious flaws that preclude this movie of being top 100 of all times , enter the dragon is a incredibly entertaining piece of cinema and the martial arts flick that can be enjoyed even by those who don't like that particular genre .",pos
5,cv521,15828,0,"one of the sweetest tales to ever be made , it's a wonderful life isn't perfect , but its good natured charm and beautiful performances light up the screen with glorious results .",pos

5,cv521,15828,9,"we see george sacrificing his hearing to save his brother's life , sacrificing his college education to save the family business , sacrificing his dream of living far away to support his brother , and even sacrificing his life to make sure his brother is happy working somewhere else .",pos
5,cv521,15828,10,"when the bank his family owns is in trouble , george gives away his honeymoon money to make sure the bank isn't sold to the evil mr . potter ( barrymore ) , who wants nothing less than to get the baileys out of bedford falls .",pos

5,cv521,15828,18,"the movie is beginning to feel dated in the details , especially in the treatment of women and men .",pos
5,cv521,15828,19,"the sex roles in the film are weirdly out of place in the 90's , like something out of a revisionist look .",pos
5,cv521,15828,20,all the men drink too much and slap their wives too much during some portions of the film .,pos
5,cv521,15828,21,"there are , however , endearing moments in all of this .",pos
5,cv521,15828,22,capra puts in just enough humor mocking the sex roles of the 50's to make the movie remarkably enjoyable .,pos
5,cv521,15828,23,"the story is hackneyed , and the ending feels , well , a little too sugarish .",pos
5,cv521,15828,24,"there's this uneasy feeling of sugar over everything , especially the sequences where george is either in trouble , or helping somebody .",pos
5,cv521,15828,25,"it's a little too nice for my liking , at times .",pos
5,cv521,15828,26,"there is , however , enough humor , enough wit , and enough of jimmy stewart to get the movie through the middle part , which would be the most difficult .",pos
5,cv521,15828,27,"but watching it's a wonderful life is never boring or difficult : it's always interesting , right until the finale , which , for all its sugar , makes delightful sense and is beautifully done .",pos
5,cv521,15828,28,"capra does have his monumental cliches , but the actors relish them and overplay everything to perfection .",pos
5,cv521,15828,29,"donna reed is perfect as the loving , obeidient wife , and lionel barrymore is gloriously grump as mr . potter .",pos
5,cv521,15828,30,"everyone else is magnificent , including bert and ernie ( ward bond and frank faylen ) .",pos
5,cv521,15828,31,"there is a general sense of goodness , as if everyone in the film knows that they are making a great film , and they relish that .",pos

5,cv521,15828,42,"it is a "" feel-good "" movie , something people complain a little too much about .",pos

5,cv522,5583,1,the opening segment is something of a foretaste of this film .,pos
5,cv522,5583,2,"there's a guy's voice telling us how he tries to imagine what his biological parents look like , and on the screen we see images of a variety of oldish men and women .",pos
5,cv522,5583,3,"as his imagination plays o n , he ( and we ) picture these motley characters in a mix-and-match shuffle of unlikely marriages , businesswomen with bums , matrons with paint salesmen , the images coming on in a faster and faster frenzy .",pos
5,cv522,5583,4,"it's not just a witty , funny summing up of the film 's themes - you might not guess it yet , but it sets the pattern for the way the story goes on .",pos
5,cv522,5583,5,"what starts out as a step in a fairly sensible direction , gets taken on a road trip , put through a detour or two and finds itself freewheeling towards an immin ent crash .",pos
5,cv522,5583,6,"that may not sound so different from the average family sitcom , and the general idea of the film doesn't , at first , seem so wildly distant from standard-issue hollywood comedy : man who was adopted as a child ( ben still er ) sets out on a journey to meet his real parents , along with his wife ( patricia arquette ) , his baby , and a pretty psychology-researcher ( tea leoni ) in tow .",pos
5,cv522,5583,7,"various mix-ups , shenanigans , oddball characters and , yup , disasters follow .",pos
5,cv522,5583,8,"but if you think you've been here before , the dialogue and the direction ( by david o . russell , who made spanking the monkey ) take it into another dimension .",pos
5,cv522,5583,9,"the dreaded t-name seems an inevitable reference point ( what with a drug overdose scene and the casting of arquette from true romance ) but really the point is that the foot-massage master hasn't got a monopoly on plot twists and fast , funny , irreverent lines , or on the absurdities of ordinary speech .",pos
5,cv522,5583,10,"whether it's about circumcision , psychic wounds , oral sex , carjacking , the beauties of the armpit area , or ronald reagan , the script never seems to run out of hilarious invention .",pos
5,cv522,5583,11,"the best thing is how these words aren't just there for the punchlines , but are great precisely because they're said in character , like tea leoni's neurotically-charged psychobabbler who's able to say under assault , "" it's understandable if you find this threatening "" .",pos
5,cv522,5583,12,"the cast is excellent throughout , and , rather than singling out anybody , kudos are due to the fine ensemble acting , with the sometimes frenetically overlapping dialogue and the sense of a dozen different reagents colliding to the point of fission .",pos
5,cv522,5583,13,"there are some elements of a woody allen film in this ( not to mention the hand-held camera and loose , improvisational feel of some scenes ) .",pos
5,cv522,5583,14,"like allen , russell's interests are in the volatile sexual politics of couples and the neurotic obsessions in both pare nts and children ( and everybody , really ) .",pos
5,cv522,5583,15,"still , if you're expecting a privileged moment of revelation and emotional outpouring a la "" murphy brown "" / "" frasier "" / fill-in-the-blank-american-comedy , well , it won't happen .",pos
5,cv522,5583,16,"the film sets up expectations like these , with the lead character's search f or his origins and his hopes of self-healing , only to knock them down .",pos
5,cv522,5583,17,"if the conventional sitcom structure is to put a slightly loopy family in catastrophic conditions only to rediscover their essential lovey one-ness , flirting with disaster's charact ers embark on a journey to seek that essential state but find themselves only plunging into more weirdness and dysfunctional chaos the further they go .",pos
5,cv522,5583,18,"and that , the film suggests , is the essential family state - and you better learn to love it .",pos

5,cv523,16615,2,"this extraordinary re-telling of bram stoker's "" dracula "" by german filmmaker werner herzog deserves the most prominent of places in cinematic vampire lore .",pos
5,cv523,16615,3,"inspired by f . w . murnau's 1922 silent film of the same name , herzog's film is a work of exquisite bleakness , an oddly touching tragedy with a beautiful and uniquely haunting quality that lingers long afterwards .",pos
5,cv523,16615,4,"the original full-length english and german language versions of nosferatu have at last received a video release by u . s . distributor anchor bay entertainment , and in gorgeous widescreen prints .",pos
5,cv523,16615,5,"until now only a shortened english language version of the film was available on video , and only in europe .",pos
5,cv523,16615,6,"both of these re-releases restore the film to its full length , but viewers should still be wary of the english version due to its often stilted dialogue .",pos
5,cv523,16615,7,"apparently the english dialogue coach herzog had on the set during filming was incompetent , and some of the voices also seem to be dubbed .",pos
5,cv523,16615,8,the german version with english subtitles remains the definitive one .,pos
5,cv523,16615,9,everyone knows the story of dracula .,pos
5,cv523,16615,10,or do they ?,pos
5,cv523,16615,11,his story has been so bastardised on film over the years that a brief reminder of the basic plot certainly won't hurt .,pos
5,cv523,16615,12,jonathan harker is a young lawyer sent to the gloomy castle dracula in transylvania to do business with a creepy count ( played by klaus kinski ) who wants to buy a house in harker's hometown .,pos

5,cv523,16615,15,"upon divining his identity as a vampire , adjani seduces the count and lures him to his death one morning as the sun rises .",pos
5,cv523,16615,16,"that is a story familiar to millions , but herzog has elevated stoker's tale into the realm of - and i use this term a tad reluctantly - cinematic art .",pos
5,cv523,16615,17,"nosferatu is as much a meditation as it is a film , shot through blue-ish and white filters and peopled with characters who perform as if they were half hypnotised .",pos
5,cv523,16615,18,"the film's surreal , dream-like quality is utterly mesmerising .",pos
5,cv523,16615,19,"there is much to enjoy , but i'll limit my praise to a few key points .",pos
5,cv523,16615,20,holding the film together is kinski's remarkable performance as count dracula .,pos
5,cv523,16615,21,"past screen portrayals , including bela lugosi's famous turn , have largely been one dimensional and tended towards camp .",pos
5,cv523,16615,22,"but kinski . . . oh boy , this is something far more compelling .",pos
5,cv523,16615,23,"aided by a startling make-up job , he portrays dracula's vampirism not simply as pure evil but as some sort of loathsome disease .",pos
5,cv523,16615,24,this man is dreadfully lonely .,pos
5,cv523,16615,25,"he lives in utter solitude , shunned by the locals for his hideous appearance and reputation for bloodlust .",pos

5,cv523,16615,27,"when he dies , you almost feel as if this man's tortured soul has been freed at last .",pos
5,cv523,16615,28,"then there's the unforgettable soundtrack , largely composed by german group popul vuh .",pos
5,cv523,16615,29,it is so eerily beautiful and evocative that it's quite impossible to imagine the film without it .,pos
5,cv523,16615,30,"popul vuh are longtime herzog collaborators and play an ancient-sounding kind of spacemusic using piano , chants , and exotic instruments .",pos
5,cv523,16615,31,when i first saw this film some years ago i was so impressed i tracked down and bought a number of their albums .,pos
5,cv523,16615,32,"the one i still listen to the most is "" tantric songs "" , from which most of the music in nosferatu is taken .",pos
5,cv523,16615,33,it's a testament to the music's depth that it is as powerful without the pictures as it is with them .,pos
5,cv523,16615,34,the album is still available on the highly respected ambient and world music label celestial harmonies .,pos
5,cv523,16615,35,this is a timely re-release by anchor bay .,pos
5,cv523,16615,36,"after francis ford coppola's unscary and woefully overblown version of bram stoker's tale in 1992 , it is a joy to go back to herzog's film and see the amazing things he has done with what is now a century-old story .",pos
5,cv523,16615,37,"to some aficionados , nosferatu is quite simply the greatest vampire film ever made .",pos
5,cv523,16615,38,"without a doubt , it is an unmistakable classic of the genre .",pos
5,cv523,16615,39,don't miss it .,pos
5,cv524,23627,0,"even if i did not know that director and co-writers james wong and jeffrey reddick of the creepy final destination helped create the hit television show the x-files , i would have inevitably made a connection .",pos
5,cv524,23627,1,"the similarities are very apparent from the inexplicable phenomenon- like plot , to the mysterious characters , to the overall dark , ominous settings .",pos
5,cv524,23627,2,"it would have been perfectly fitting to see fbi agents mulder and scully investigate this case , they witness stuff like this on a weekly basis ( in fact mulder and scully would have been a much more welcome change to the bland one dimensional fbi agents seen in this movie ) .",pos
5,cv524,23627,3,"another more important similarity , is that both succeed in entertaining and thrilling at the same time .",pos
5,cv524,23627,4,"this is a great accomplishment for a teen horror movie , especially when compared to some of the trash , of the same genre , released in the last couple of years ( urban legend and i still know what you did last summer are classic examples from the bunch ) .",pos
5,cv524,23627,5,what helps final destination is its unique premise .,pos
5,cv524,23627,6,"unlike your average horror flick in which some invincible psycho with a knife chases blonde cheerleaders , the villain presented is unusual , it's the grim reaper .",pos
5,cv524,23627,7,this being already has predestined when and how you will die .,pos
5,cv524,23627,8,"according to the brief history lesson given in this film , everyone was meant to die at a certain time , some people at 100 , others at 17 , whatever death chooses .",pos
5,cv524,23627,9,"what is unique about death is that it's already dead , so you can't really kill it .",pos
5,cv524,23627,10,the only way to defeat death is to cheat it ; the question is how do you do that ?,pos
5,cv524,23627,11,this dilemma is what faces alex and a group of teenagers .,pos
5,cv524,23627,12,"alex has been having some dreams that the airplane which will take his class on a trip to paris will crash , leaving no survivors .",pos
5,cv524,23627,13,alex begins to realize that his dreams are a little too real and eventually gets himself and six others kicked off the plane right before it takes off .,pos
5,cv524,23627,14,"shortly after , the plane does indeed crash leaving some of the seven survivors confused and others feeling immortal .",pos
5,cv524,23627,15,"however , death isn't through with them yet .",pos
5,cv524,23627,16,"it gradually kills off the seven one by one , leaving those currently still alive frantically trying to trick death again .",pos
5,cv524,23627,17,"the plot allows for some of the most creative , original death scenes i have seen in a while .",pos
5,cv524,23627,18,"some scenes build up the perfect amount of tension until an elaborate climax , others are so unexpected they will leave your jaw wide open in shock .",pos
5,cv524,23627,19,creativity and originality are two adjectives lacking in most horror films nowadays but final destination is not like most horror films .,pos
5,cv524,23627,20,"sure , it has your traditional share of jerks and outsiders ( ali larter's character is particularly annoying ) , but the shocks , from the beginning to the end , are extremely entertaining .",pos
5,cv524,23627,21,also director wong has the sense not to take the movie too seriously .,pos
5,cv524,23627,22,he knows its just another entertaining guilty pleasure that won't win any academy awards ( not even a golden globe ) .,pos
5,cv524,23627,23,"the myriad of inside jokes and gags ( the characters are named after famous horror directors , one character who plays a jerk is named carter , like x-files creator chris carter , and a song by john denver , who died in a plane crash , plays whenever death is near ) show this movie is a bunch of guys having a good time making a movie .",pos

5,cv525,16122,10,it would pass as deadpan humour if it wasn't spoken with such resigned weariness .,pos
5,cv525,16122,11,this sets the tone for the rest of the movie .,pos
5,cv525,16122,12,"there is humour and idiosyncracy at the periphery , but at the centre there is frustration and futility , and sorrow for the ways in which the logic of profit reduces people , until their worth is equated solely with their earning capacity .",pos
5,cv525,16122,13,"there is an element of political commentary in this critique of the mechanisms of capitalism and the stultifying social environment it creates , but in drifting clouds the political is subsumed by the personal : the movie is about two people and what happens to them , and nothing else matters .",pos
5,cv525,16122,14,"lauri and ilona live lives starved for friendship , respect , culture , passion .",pos
5,cv525,16122,15,"they go to the movies , and walk out past old posters for l'atalante and l'argent , but the movie they have just seen is a pointless , violent , unfunny comedy .",pos
5,cv525,16122,16,"their house and workplaces are uniformly unpleasant , painted and upholstered in lifeless colours ( ugly greens , dull reds , insipid blues ) , full of inelegantly functional objects and appliances .",pos
5,cv525,16122,17,"the art design is impeccable in its tawdriness , and director aki kaurism ? ki often matches the colour of characters' clothes with the background colour and/or lighting , so that it seems as if they are almost physically fading into the environment .",pos
5,cv525,16122,18,there is no suggestion of sexuality in the relationship ; ilona and lauri sleep in separate beds and their gestures of affection lack the heat of desire ; their lives are now bound by something more complex and desperate than love .,pos
5,cv525,16122,19,"their downward , downsized , downtrodden lives have a momentum that is almost comic , as one setback succeeds another , bottoming out when lauri stakes all their remaining money on the spin of a roulette wheel .",pos
5,cv525,16122,20,"it must have been tempting to play the story for more laughs , more farce , more deadpan wit , but the film's great strength is the sober , empathic manner in which it observes lauri and ilona's misfortunes .",pos
5,cv525,16122,21,irony would be an injustice .,pos
5,cv525,16122,22,situations and settings are broad and exaggerated--this is not realism--but they are not distorted .,pos
5,cv525,16122,23,the emotions are authentic .,pos
5,cv525,16122,24,"if it is difficult to laugh at anything that happens , despite the droll performances , the laconic humour , that's because kaurism ? ki brings such compassion and understanding to the manifold indignities that are suffered .",pos
5,cv525,16122,25,"he shows us how humiliating it must be for a woman of thirty-eight , who has worked long and hard to win a respectable position , to be forced to accept a job as a dishwasher in a two-bit restaurant ; how humiliating it must be for a man nearing 50 to confront his wife's former employer , demanding the rest of her wages , only to have the crap beaten out of him , unable to land a single punch , when the employer and his cronies refuse to give him the money .",pos
5,cv525,16122,26,"all this is observed keenly , with great economy : every cut , every line of dialogue , is judicious .",pos
5,cv525,16122,27,"if most films are novelistic in their telling , this one brings the focus and concentration of a short story to bear .",pos
5,cv525,16122,28,but what is gained in nuance and acumen is rather undermined by the sense that the material barely accommodates the 96-minute running length .,pos
5,cv525,16122,29,"i have seen many movies far less profound , less humane , less necessary than drifting clouds , but they filled me with an urge to watch them again , and this one did not .",pos
5,cv525,16122,30,it does not need to be seen twice : its every detail and implication can be absorbed in one viewing .,pos
5,cv525,16122,31,"it is not a movie that will be seen by a large audience , because it cannot be pitched to one .",pos
5,cv525,16122,32,there is no selling point .,pos
5,cv525,16122,33,"it is all understatement , restraint , melancholy .",pos
5,cv525,16122,34,"the characters are unremarkable , their best years behind them , their dreams dissipated ; it takes all the effort they can muster just to pay the bills .",pos
5,cv525,16122,35,"this does not make them less fascinating , merely less marketable , which is a shame , because this is a movie which should be seen , precisely because it pays attention to people and emotions that most movies prefer to ignore .",pos
5,cv525,16122,36,"it engages us and touches us and resolves--surprisingly , and movingly--into something resembling a happy ending .",pos
5,cv525,16122,37,the only thing greater than the ill-luck that governs the characters' lives is their refusal to give in to despair .,pos
5,cv525,16122,38,"their persistence is rewarded with what might be called a "" feel-good "" ending elsewhere , but not here , because this ending differs in kind from most such endings : this one has truly been earned .",pos

5,cv526,12083,4,the gimmick is that it's really two stories : the film follows the life of helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) down two directions .,pos
5,cv526,12083,5,"in the beginning , likeable gal 'helen' ( gwyneth paltrow ) gets unexpectedly fired from her advertising job .",pos

5,cv526,12083,8,"the film shows what happens in both paths , switching back and forth between intertwined , parallel stories .",pos
5,cv526,12083,9,"in story one , helen meets a charming and talkative monty python fan named james ( john hannah ) on the train .",pos
5,cv526,12083,10,"arriving home early , she discovers that her live-in , gerry ( john lynch ) , is having sex with his former lover lydia ( jeanne tripplehorn ) .",pos
5,cv526,12083,11,this leads to a life where helen moves out .,pos
5,cv526,12083,12,"helen's winsome new friend james helps her recover from a broken heart , and encourages her to start her own business .",pos
5,cv526,12083,13,"in story two , helen experiences a different fate .",pos
5,cv526,12083,14,"she misses the train , never meets james , and doesn't get home early enough to discover gerry's infidelity .",pos
5,cv526,12083,15,"in this new life , helen takes up odd menial jobs , and faces the constant sneaking suspicion that all is not right with her relationship with gerry .",pos

5,cv526,12083,17,"opinion : rejoice all ye monty python fans , gwyneth paltrow fans , and watchers of quirky romance flicks .",pos
5,cv526,12083,18,at last here's proof that there's still creativity in 1990s filmmaking .,pos
5,cv526,12083,19,sliding doors is refreshingly different from anything this year .,pos
5,cv526,12083,20,"not only is it a well-acted , heartwarming film , but it's also easily gwyneth paltrow's best recent performance .",pos
5,cv526,12083,21,"when helen ( paltrow ) screams that her unfaithful boyfriend is a 'shagging wanker , ' ( a british phrase better left untranslated ) she sounds like she knows what she's talking about !",pos
5,cv526,12083,22,nor does sliding doors go overboard with formulaic true love or other stereotypes .,pos
5,cv526,12083,23,"nobody scrambles around in danger , screaming , "" i will find you no matter what , my darling ! """,pos
5,cv526,12083,24,"when helen finds herself on a boat in the starlight with james , she doesn't take the easy way out and leap into his arms , since she's supposed to be recovering from heartache .",pos
5,cv526,12083,25,and handsome live-in boyfriend gerry isn't the stereotypical screen hunk ( either a stud or a snob ) .,pos
5,cv526,12083,26,"instead he's a nervous and indecisive , almost helpless hunk .",pos
5,cv526,12083,27,"another example : when one of the protagonists lies wounded in a hospital , sliding doors gives us neither the 'hospital miracle' nor a maudlin tragedy but surprises us with a third variation .",pos
5,cv526,12083,28,"in other words , all of the characters seem non-stereotyped , human , and local .",pos
5,cv526,12083,29,there are minor inconveniences .,pos
5,cv526,12083,30,"since sliding doors switches back and forth between two possible fates , it's occasionally difficult to distinguish between the two .",pos
5,cv526,12083,31,"distinguishing between the two stories isn't a problem in the scenes containing paltrow , who sports two different hairstyles .",pos
5,cv526,12083,32,"but in scenes containing only lydia and gerry , who look the same in both stories , it's slightly confusing .",pos

5,cv527,10123,8,"its protagonist , bob flanagan , who died at the age of 52 , suffered from cystic fibrosis , a mortal disease which debilitates the lungs by saturating them with thick coats of mucus , preventing him from normal breathing .",pos
5,cv527,10123,9,the movie is about much more than recouperating ( or attempting to ) from this disease .,pos
5,cv527,10123,10,"an audacious , fabulously triumphant docudrama , "" sick "" chronicles the life of flanagan and his vicious , unthinkable acts of sadomasochism conducted with his mistress of 15 years , sheree rose , who amazingly provided much of the footage for the film .",pos
5,cv527,10123,11,"flanagan's idelogy crosses the realms of rebelliousness and becomes transcendental , similar to terry zwigoff's brilliant 1994 "" crumb "" , which also explored the dysfunction of an artist by painting not a sympathetic portrait , but a realistic one .",pos
5,cv527,10123,12,both crumb and flanagan revelled in their defects .,pos
5,cv527,10123,13,"but flanagan was not only a man content on enduring the pain via lungs , he inflicted acts of pain on himself at a very young age , courageously defying god ( he was an irish catholic ) and turning his body into a work of art , which he unraveled in museums and lectures .",pos

5,cv527,10123,16,"flanagan was a man of great intelligence , wit and humor , as well as adopting a sense of candidness scarcely seen in modern filmmaking .",pos
5,cv527,10123,17,"not only did he approach his disease with humor , peforming burlesque acts in front of an audience , he was also revitalized by his approachment .",pos
5,cv527,10123,18,most with cystic fibrosis do not make it past their earlier twenties ( there's also a subplot involving a female devotee who knew death was awaiting her .,pos
5,cv527,10123,19,),pos
5,cv527,10123,20,"but the most outstanding thing about "" sick "" is flanagan's relationship with sheree .",pos
5,cv527,10123,21,"brimming with honesty , sensual stimulation and unapologetically sad moments of pain , their powerful bond lifts "" sick "" into a rare cinematic high , where we forget we are in an auditorium and become a part of these people .",pos
5,cv527,10123,22,"the last scene , where we see the hero murmuring the last words to his wife in a hospital bed , as he struggles for his last moments of life , is raw , tender , hideous .",pos
5,cv527,10123,23,it goes a step beyond cinematic intimacy .,pos
5,cv528,10822,0,"studio expectations must not have been high for "" great expectations "" -- the film's release date was pushed from late december to late january at what appeared to be the last minute , therefore putting any academy awards chances it has off until this time in 1999 .",pos
5,cv528,10822,1,"it's actually a smart move , because while this updated take on the charles dickens tale isn't quite oscar fodder , it * is * strong enough to be distinguished from the cinematic dumping ground that usually makes up the first five or six weeks of any given year .",pos

5,cv528,10822,4,"there's icy , 11-year-old estella ( raquel beaudene ) , a pseudo-playmate of finn's ; ms . dinsmoor ( anne bancroft ) , estella's auntie who's quite off-kilter over a past romance that never took off ; and a mysterious prisoner ( robert de niro ) whom finn saves the life of .",pos
5,cv528,10822,5,"finn , who lives with his sister's affable boyfriend ( lone star's chris cooper ) , fancies himself an aspiring artist , and proves his prowess by whipping up an unusual portrait of estella using only ms . dinsmoor's lipstick , eyebrow pencil and the wallpaper from her dilapidating mansion .",pos

5,cv528,10822,10,"comparisons with the afore-mentioned "" romeo + juliet "" seem inevitable since these films are the only ones in recent memory to plop classic drama into a current setting .",pos
5,cv528,10822,11,""" great expectations "" is a much better venture , though , because it treats its source with even-handed respect , where "" romeo "" was never quite sure whether to be a spoof , a homage or both .",pos
5,cv528,10822,12,"the movie is a visual banquet thanks to emmanuel lubezki's sexy cinematography ; notably , he captures a revisited fountain kiss between the two leads with a luscious , erotic charge that's steamier than the film's ( surprisingly muted ) love scenes .",pos
5,cv528,10822,13,"the eclectic rock soundtrack compliments the on-screen action beautifully , especially new songs by tori amos , mono and duncan sheik .",pos
5,cv528,10822,14,"acting credits are first-rate , often hiding the screenplay's occasional slip-ups .",pos
5,cv528,10822,15,"hawke is sincere and solid as a leading man ( something we also learned from "" gattaca "" ) , and his finn is quite a likeable guy .",pos
5,cv528,10822,16,"paltrow's estella , on the other hand , is rather underdeveloped .",pos
5,cv528,10822,17,"while the actress is at her icily seductive best , we're not told very much about her character , and as a result , it's often hard to understand why finn would appreciate her beyond a physical level ( but , oh , * what * a physical level ) ; sometimes , we root for finn although we don't quite understand why she's fueling his fire .",pos
5,cv528,10822,18,"robert de niro is nice and sophisticated in the benevolent kind of role he rarely gets to play ; on the other end of the acting spectrum is bancroft , a macabre , throaty delight who mambos and sucks down cigarettes with an eerie enthusiasm that would make norma desmond jealous .",pos
5,cv528,10822,19,alfonso cuaron's visually elegant direction helps to distract from the dry moments that pop up more frequently around the movie's climax .,pos
5,cv528,10822,20,another problem is predictability ; you can guess your way through the plot even if you aren't familiar with the story .,pos
5,cv528,10822,21,"despite its script flaws , though , "" great expectations "" is undeniably romantic without being corny or gloppy .",pos
5,cv528,10822,22,"and frankly , it's nice to see a film that embraces softened sensuality other than explicit sexuality .",pos

5,cv529,10420,12,"this might sound like the kind of cliches films like this are notorious for ( over- ) using , but it works here because the film knows how to get our attention quickly .",pos
5,cv529,10420,13,"it's not about the payoff because it's obvious bond will escape , instead , it's the way it processes the action sequences by going over the top and not apologizing for it , all the while creating for witty , hysterical comedy .",pos
5,cv529,10420,14,"it seems less emphasis is placed on the villains in thrillers anymore , because of political correctness , and just plain copping-out on behalf of the filmmakers ( even the term "" villain "" sounds passe ) .",pos
5,cv529,10420,15,"what the film deserves kudos for is its ability to create a villain as heinous as they come , yet making him seem completely plausible .",pos
5,cv529,10420,16,"jonathon pryce delivers a perfect performance as the arrogant , cunning elliot carver , a media mogul whose goal is to take over the world , that is , through his massive media empire , not through nuclear weapons .",pos
5,cv529,10420,17,"through some interesting detective work , bond and the english ministry of defense believe carver is behind the trouble brewing in the southern asian seas as a way to create and accurately cover his own news .",pos

5,cv529,10420,19,"surprisingly , this is about as detailed as the story allows the specific plot to become .",pos
5,cv529,10420,20,"the film's hook is the action , and of course those cool gadgets and we get plenty of that here as bond goes out to investigate carver and finds himself in a jam or two along the way .",pos
5,cv529,10420,21,the story works much like bond himself - always on the run and concentrates more on the individual conflicts than any general plot .,pos
5,cv529,10420,22,"somehow a chinese agent , wai lin ( yeoh ) , bumps into bond a few too many times and they find themselves working together .",pos
5,cv529,10420,23,"the chemistry between brosnon and yeoh is rigid , but also works because of this , not in spite of it .",pos
5,cv529,10420,24,"the two are constantly on the run from carver and his goons , yet the film manages to balance the stunts and special effects with its clever story .",pos
5,cv529,10420,25,"although "" tomorrow never dies "" is far from perfect , it is quite an impressive film in terms of its ability to be so cliche and cartoony and not make plausibility an issue .",pos

5,cv548,17731,17,8 mm certainly joins the rank of these minor classics and is perhaps most reminiscent of falling down in that both films present an average man who self-destructs before the audience's eyes .,pos
5,cv548,17731,18,"8 mm was written by andrew kevin walker , who also penned the academy award-winning thriller seven a few years back .",pos
5,cv548,17731,19,"like seven , 8 mm is full of dialogue which haunts you well after leaving the theater .",pos
5,cv548,17731,20,welles is searching for answers .,pos
5,cv548,17731,21,"how could anyone possibly drug and then slowly , methodically , sadistically kill a teenaged girl to make a film ?",pos
5,cv548,17731,22,"when confronting one of the perpretrators at the end , the murderer responds that there are no reasons .",pos
5,cv548,17731,23,he just enjoys it .,pos
5,cv548,17731,24,"that , walker seems to suggest , is where the real terror lays : not in the crime itself but in the fact that rational motives do not exist .",pos
5,cv548,17731,25,a couple minor faults led me to my four-star rating ( five stars is the highest rating i give ) .,pos
5,cv548,17731,26,"one , i found it a little difficult , early on , to accept the fact that a hardened private detective would get physically disgusted when first seeing a snuff film .",pos
5,cv548,17731,27,"yes , snuff is a horrible thing , but a detective of welles' caliber has probably encountered awful things before .",pos
5,cv548,17731,28,"second , some of the clues welles gathers are too convenient .",pos
5,cv548,17731,29,"he discovers , for example , the victim's diary in her private bathroom , despite the fact the the police , the fbi , and her own mother have all investigated the room before .",pos
5,cv548,17731,30,"finally , the closing scene seemed trite and improbable considering the rest of the film .",pos
5,cv548,17731,31,"despite the above criticisms , 8 mm is an engrossing story .",pos
5,cv548,17731,32,"one of the best scenes in the film occurs toward the end as a crazed welles , who no longer seems like a hero , brutally beats one of the pornographers responsible for the snuff film .",pos
5,cv548,17731,33,"he pulls a gun on the man and , for a relatively long amount of time , struggles to decide whether or not to kill him .",pos
5,cv548,17731,34,"he then leaves the building and calls the victim's mother , in the middle of the night , to basically see if she would support the action .",pos
5,cv548,17731,35,"the entire scene is tense , unpredictable , and emotionally charged .",pos
5,cv548,17731,36,"rarely , anymore , do horror films or thrillers provoke suspense in me as 8 mm , with scenes like this , did .",pos
5,cv548,17731,37,8 mm is most certainly not for the faint of heart .,pos
5,cv548,17731,38,"this is a graphic , oftentimes unflinching , look into the darkness which resides in both ordinary and extraordinary people .",pos
5,cv548,17731,39,"if you're prepared for a film of this nature , i give it an enthusiastic recommendation .",pos
5,cv549,21443,0,"to me , nicolas cage sounds like an ideal choice for the lead role in a martin scorsese film .",pos
5,cv549,21443,1,"despite the rantings that sean penn so rudely expressed , the actor remains a gifted and versatile screen presence .",pos
5,cv549,21443,2,"ever since the big success of the action-thriller `face/off' in 1997 , the hollywood road has been a rocky one for mr . cage .",pos
5,cv549,21443,3,the perpetually awful assassination thriller `snake eyes' was one of 1998's worst films .,pos
5,cv549,21443,4,`8mm' was a disappointing lost cause .,pos
5,cv549,21443,5,"but who better than scorsese to match cage's wit and intensity , which he does in miraculous fashion with `bringing out the dead' .",pos
5,cv549,21443,6,"cage delivers one of his finest performances as frank pierce , a new york city emergency paramedic who is running on fumes from day-to-day .",pos
5,cv549,21443,7,"after five years of the stress-inducing job , frank basically just staggers onward , relying on heavy doses of caffeine and booze until his shift finally ends .",pos
5,cv549,21443,8,"he also begins seeing the ghosts of past patients who died under his care , namely a young girl named rose , who stares back at him with pale features at every street corner in new york .",pos

5,cv549,21443,10,frank is accompanied by a fresh face every night in the ambulance .,pos
5,cv549,21443,11,"the first is larry ( john goodman ) , who always has food on the brain .",pos
5,cv549,21443,12,"the second is marcus ( ving rhames ) , a deeply religious black man who incorporates the power of jesus into a regular rescue operation .",pos
5,cv549,21443,13,"and finally , tom ( tom sizemore ) is a deranged sociopath hungry for blood .",pos
5,cv549,21443,14,"i found it unique how scorsese used each of these characters for a single shift with frank , but they never figured into the actual plot .",pos
5,cv549,21443,15,"each is merely a colorful presence to help develop frank's character , because `bringing out the dead' is predominantly a study of his mind and detailed personality .",pos
5,cv549,21443,16,"the one character alongside frank that truly comes into play is mary ( patricia arquette ) , the daughter of a newly admitted patient who suffered from a severe heart attack .",pos
5,cv549,21443,17,"arquette , who recently received the wounds of christ in `stigmata' , performs well around real-life husband cage .",pos
5,cv549,21443,18,"it's unfortunate that , after such intriguing character trials and tribulations , the relationship between frank and mary slips during a mishandled , ineffective finale .",pos
5,cv549,21443,19,"the movie belongs to the one-two punch of cage and scorsese , who were born to collaborate their efforts in an arrangement similar to `bringing out the dead' .",pos
5,cv549,21443,20,"although it certainly lacks the grit and hard-edge of something like `goodfellas' , scorsese manages to hit a nerve with his latest picture .",pos
5,cv549,21443,21,the incredible camera-work and photography represent stunning flashes of brilliance in an otherwise unspectacular conglomeration .,pos
5,cv549,21443,22,"fans will be pleased to find the director has returned to his abrasive , darkly humorous roots after somewhat of a departure with 1997's `kundun' .",pos
5,cv549,21443,23,does `bringing out the dead' rival scorsese's finest work ?,pos
5,cv549,21443,24,only occasionally .,pos
5,cv549,21443,25,"some of the film feels surprisingly limp , but there is enough energy in it's interesting material and breathtaking visual appearance to suffice .",pos
5,cv549,21443,26,"those expecting a grisly , risqu ? product may be somewhat disheartened at the fairly straight-arrow approach - but it's still a solid , admirable effort .",pos
5,cv549,21443,27,"`bringing out the dead' was written by the acclaimed paul schrader , who collaborated with scorsese on such classics as `taxi driver' and `raging bull' .",pos
5,cv549,21443,28,"schrader's script is full of moments - wonderful , sharply defined moments - that are sorted throughout the remainder of his meandering screenplay .",pos
5,cv549,21443,29,the exceptional aspects of the film are it's astounding technical credits and the amazing cast .,pos
5,cv549,21443,30,"goodman and sizemore are both electric ( well , mainly sizemore ) , but it's the phenomenal ving rhames who deserves a second look .",pos

5,cv550,22211,2,"although , as typical disaster movies go , daylight isn't that bad .",pos
5,cv550,22211,3,"admittedly , it seems to rip off a great deal of its plot devices from disaster flicks of days gone by ( think poseidon adventure ) .",pos
5,cv550,22211,4,"but the decent dialogue and surprisingly good acting make up for the "" haven't i seen this scene somewhere before ? """,pos
5,cv550,22211,5,feeling that creeps up all too often during the film .,pos
5,cv550,22211,6,sylvester stallone stars as the recently fired head of new york's emergency response team .,pos

5,cv550,22211,10,glad you asked .,pos
5,cv550,22211,11,through a whole sequence of entirely probable events ( about as probable as hitting the lottery ) a large explosion takes place in the lincoln tunnel running under the hudson river in new york city .,pos
5,cv550,22211,12,"the explosion results in the tunnel collapsing at both ends , which causes not only massive loss of life , but traps a dozen people inside the wreckage of the tunnel .",pos
5,cv550,22211,13,"good old sly , who is only feet away from entering the tunnel when it collapses , offers his services to the rescuers , who gladly accept it .",pos
5,cv550,22211,14,"sly then enters the tunnel through a vent shaft ( think judge dredd ) which he can only go in , and not out off , and proceeds to try to rescue those trapped inside .",pos
5,cv550,22211,15,"so begins the fun , but the fun has to be quick , because this tunnel has started to spring a leak .",pos
5,cv550,22211,16,the acting is about what you would expect of a stallone movie .,pos
5,cv550,22211,17,"not superb by any means , but far above some of his other films ( think judge dredd again ) .",pos
5,cv550,22211,18,"daylight's acting is probably average , or a little above , in terms of this sort of genre , starring this particular star .",pos
5,cv550,22211,19,"amy brenneman is the only actor of any note , and she does a pretty good job as stallone's reluctant helper .",pos
5,cv550,22211,20,"oh yeah , stallone's real life son , sage , is in this too .",pos
5,cv550,22211,21,sage -- nice name .,pos

5,cv550,22211,25,"the plot runs along the same lines as the acting -- interesting , but predictable .",pos
5,cv550,22211,26,mostly due to the fact that it was pretty well recycled from a dozen other action flicks .,pos
5,cv550,22211,27,the biggest problem with a film of this nature is that they try to cram too many things into the movie .,pos
5,cv550,22211,28,"as soon as the cast clears one seemingly impossible hurdle , another one seems to pop right up , even worse than the last one .",pos
5,cv550,22211,29,"i realize that it wouldn't be much of a movie otherwise , but it does make the movie a bit predictable .",pos
5,cv550,22211,30,"adding to the predictability is the cast of characters , which of course , has to include at least one or two difficult people who want to do things their own way and think the qualified guy ( in this case stallone ) doesn't know what he is doing .",pos
5,cv550,22211,31,why is it in disaster movies we can never have everyone agree with each other and all work together ?,pos
5,cv550,22211,32,would this be too much to ask ?,pos
5,cv550,22211,33,can't we all just get along ?,pos
5,cv550,22211,34,special effects weren't bad -- but i've certainly seen better .,pos
5,cv550,22211,35,"some of the scenes , while fun to watch , were such blatant rip-offs that you had to wonder if scripts from old movies were just copied verbatim .",pos
5,cv550,22211,36,"especially all of the scenes that involved anything underwater ( the tunnel , of course , starts to flood ) .",pos
5,cv550,22211,37,"i really expected gene hackman , roddy mcdowell and ernest borgnine to appear at any minute -- i wasn't sure if i was watching daylight or the poseidon adventure .",pos
5,cv550,22211,38,"i suppose if you have to rip off a movie for good ideas , the poseidon adventure is a good one to use .",pos
5,cv550,22211,39,the underwater sequences ( aside from the deja vu ) were very well shot and worked fairly well .,pos
5,cv550,22211,40,they were the best part of the movie by a long shot .,pos
5,cv550,22211,41,better than average stallone flick .,pos
5,cv550,22211,42,i realize that's not saying much when the man has judge dredd on his resume .,pos

5,cv552,10016,2,"like its own opening shot , from out of the darkness boogie nights triumphantly explodes upon the film scene with stunning authority and clarity , persuasively heralding its helmer paul thomas anderson as a bonafide major talent .",pos
5,cv552,10016,3,"a sprawling epic set in the heart of the disco era and focused upon the ascension and decline of a troupe in the adult film industry , boogie nights is an astonishingly ambitious feature film which is completely effective both as an utterly entertaining joyride and as a strikingly impressive piece of filmmaking .",pos
5,cv552,10016,4,"the film follows a soft-spoken young man , eddie adams ( mark wahlberg ) from torrance , through his induction into the erotic picture business to stardom , and later , to a harrowingly precipitous drop .",pos
5,cv552,10016,5,"as boogie nights opens , he's toiling as a dishwasher in a trendy san fernando valley nightclub , and living at home under the thumb of a tyrannical mother who denigrates him at every opportunity .",pos
5,cv552,10016,6,"recruited by fatherly jack horner ( a rejuvenated burt reynolds ) , a successful porn filmmaker , eddie abandons his old life in favour of a new one as dirk diggler , pornstar .",pos
5,cv552,10016,7,"wholeheartedly embraced by jack's troupe , including the maternal amber waves ( julianne moore ) , reed rothchild ( john c . reilly ) , buck swope ( don cheadle ) , rollergirl ( heather graham ) , dirk and his "" one special thing "" are quickly propelled to the top of his field , fulfilling his mantra of being a "" big bright shining star "" .",pos
5,cv552,10016,8,"his lack of discipline , however , incites a chain of circumstances which sees dirk and his friends unravel as a new decade is ushered in .",pos
5,cv552,10016,9,"the element of boogie nights which literally commands attention is the bravura direction by mr . anderson , whose fascination and prowess with the camera is obvious .",pos
5,cv552,10016,10,"from the terrific tracking shot throughout a nightclub which opens the film and introduces the players through to the showy sequence in the camera follows a female partygoer diving into a pool , mr . anderson's accomplished command of the camera is without question .",pos
5,cv552,10016,11,"while novice directors often demonstrate an unfortunate lack of restraint in terms of flamboyant camerawork which ultimately proves to be aggravating , impertinent and self-congratulatory ( case in point : marc rocco's unforgettable perpetual-motion helming of murder in the first ) , in boogie nights every zoom or pan by mr . anderson , be it slow and deliberate or energetically sharp , is purposeful and potent .",pos
5,cv552,10016,12,"it's a rarity and a delight to discover such a confidently assured work so early in a filmmaker's career -- boogie nights is only his second feature film , following up his debut feature from earlier this year , hard eight -- and although it's somewhat derivative ( his storytelling style is reminiscent of robert altman , while in terms of visuals he's clearly influenced by martin scorsese ) , at least he's borrowing from some of the best , and it's entirely effective within the context of this film .",pos
5,cv552,10016,13,"while boogie nights is astonishingly polished from a technical perspective , in terms of sheer entertainment value it's also rollicking good fun , with a wickedly deadpan sense of humour .",pos
5,cv552,10016,14,"the film perfectly captures the essence of the disco period in terms of music , clothes , hairstyles , dance , idioms , and culture , aided immeasurably by impeccable production design by bob ziembicki and costume design by mark bridges , and boogie nights convincingly catapults the audience back to this recent , pre-aids-scare period in american history where uninhibited , free-wheeling lifestyles abounded .",pos
5,cv552,10016,15,"while much of the film's humour pertains to the characters' obliviousness of now-outdated aspects of their lives then prevalent in society -- a prime example is part-time salesman buck swope's demo of a stereo system with an eight-track tape , and inviting a prospective customer to get 'freaky deaky' with the music -- it's elicited with an undercurrent not of ridicule , but of wistful reminiscence , and some the throwback elements in the film are strangely wondrous .",pos
5,cv552,10016,16,"a giant ensemble disco dance production number in a nightclub is funny , to be sure , but oddly magical , and the sequence which lovingly explores eddie/dirk's bedroom , completely adorned with posters and elements of iconic 1970s figures ( farrah fawcett , cheryl tiegs , bruce lee ) is breathtaking .",pos
5,cv552,10016,17,"ably supported by a well-selected collection of period music ( all of which purportedly came straight from mr . anderson's personal collection ) , there's a clear affection for the era in boogie nights .",pos
5,cv552,10016,18,it's the period aspect and the playfully comic nostaligism of boogie nights which has been played up in its marketing campaign in deference of the pornography element of the storyline ; the film's promotional trailer markedly avoids any explicit reference to the adult film industry which unites its characters .,pos
5,cv552,10016,19,"after the debacle with 1996's milos forman film , the people vs .",pos
5,cv552,10016,20,"larry flynt , another finely-crafted work which was knocked off the market prematurely due to controversy regarding its pornography-related storyline , the new line marketing team faced a unique challenge with boogie nights in terms of attempting to deemphasize the relatively risque erotic picture element of the story in order to increase salability to the general public .",pos
5,cv552,10016,21,"however , while boogie nights delves into the world of the adult film industry of two decades ago , it's hardly a lurid or seamy film -- given the subject matter , there's very little nudity , and virtually none of it can be construed as gratuitous -- and boogie nights smartly depicts erotic filmmaking not as a hotbed of carnality , but simply as a business .",pos
5,cv552,10016,22,"the glimpses on the sets of jack horner's shoots reveal that while the films he makes are intended to titillate , there's a candid matter-of-factness in terms of sex ; his cast and crew are professionals who are merely doing a job , and it's refreshing that the obvious cliches of depravity and sinful lechery often linked to dismissive portraits of adult filmmaking , such as coercion or debauchery , are avoided .",pos
5,cv552,10016,23,"if anything , boogie nights is more interested in the process of adult filmmaking than the adult films themselves .",pos
5,cv552,10016,24,jack horner's dream is an honourable one -- he genuinely aspires to make a great film -- and to some degree boogie nights is reminiscent of ed wood ( albeit lacking a certain wistful innocence ) .,pos
5,cv552,10016,25,"in both films , the world of quickie low-budget filmmaking is explored , and both jack horner and the version of ed wood by tim burton , scott alexander , and larry karaszewski share similar mindsets -- jack's retort of "" there are shadows in light , baby "" to his cinematographer's complaint about poor set lighting echoes back to ed wood's "" it's not about the little details , it's about the big picture ! """,pos
5,cv552,10016,26,rant when it is pointed out that his graveyard set for plan 9 from outer space appears patently false .,pos
5,cv552,10016,27,"in boogie nights and ed wood , the aspirations of the respective filmmakers' prove to be bemusing , not in their intentions -- there's nothing inherently silly in the goal of making an 'artistic' erotic picture -- but in the degree that they miss the mark .",pos
5,cv552,10016,28,"much like the humour lacing ed wood , the laughs involving jack horner are double-edged ; after viewing a hilarious excerpt from one of his latest films which hybridizes the james bond and porn genres , when jack breathes "" this is the best work i've ever done "" , it's genuinely funny , but given his utter sincerity , also possesses a tinge of sadness .",pos
5,cv552,10016,29,mr . anderson is at this point clearly a greater talent as a director than a screenwriter .,pos
5,cv552,10016,30,"while boogie nights shows great inventiveness in staging , there really isn't any clever dialogue in the film , though a valid point certainly can be made that none of the film's characters particularly lend themselves to thoughtful verbal exchanges ; when one considers that the film's * protagonist * literally doesn't say a single insightful thing throughout the entire 152 minute running time , it's no wonder why the playfully inane "" how much can you bench ? """,pos
5,cv552,10016,31,banter between dirk and reed constitutes one of the film's finest exchanges .,pos
5,cv552,10016,32,"and while mr . anderson creates a rich collection of fascinating characters , it's problematic that some of the the threads given to the film's characters are simply stale material -- julianne moore's child custody battle is fairly cliched stuff , better suited for a less risque and uninspired tv-movie version of her character's story , and far less interesting than the thread dealing with her woefully hackneyed filmmaking ambitions .",pos
5,cv552,10016,33,"still , even if he doesn't always know what to do with his characters , mr . anderson most definitely captures their essences , and his resolutely nonjudgemental affection for them is infectious -- misguided , even aimless , hopelessly naive , self-destructive , insufferable : i loved them just the same .",pos
5,cv552,10016,34,"in any case , it's hard to pick nits with a screenplay which contains one of the most audacious and inspired ( and ultimately best-executed ) scenes of the year : a scene where dirk diggler and reed rothchild are dragged along by their loose-cannon compadre to the home of drug baron rahad jackson ( a mesmerizing alfred molina in an unforgettable performance , even if it's a small one ) in a suicidal drug deal scam , only to find that the millionaire is a crazed eccentric ( the part where he stops the deal to listen to the crescendo of night ranger's "" sister christian "" on his stereo system is sheer brilliance ) flanked by an armed bodyguard .",pos
5,cv552,10016,35,"if this scene already wasn't tense enough with these elements , mr . anderson introduces a chinese boy that wanders through the scene , who for no discernable reason is tossing firecrackers around the room , pushing the scene to a new , surreal level of delightful giddiness .",pos
5,cv552,10016,36,there are some other interesting touches in boogie nights .,pos
5,cv552,10016,37,"mr . anderson recycles the use of long methodical chimes on the soundtrack from hard eight ; here , it accompanies the violent intercut sequences which depict the prostration of various characters to frightening effect .",pos
5,cv552,10016,38,"similarly , a painful scene where crew member scotty j ( philip seymour hoffman ) breaks down in tears in the driver's seat , sobbing "" i'm so stupid "" after being rebuffed by dirk after an awkward but heartfelt advance is strikingly played out exactly as a later scene with dirk in the driver's seat after a particularly tumultuous and traumatic evening .",pos
5,cv552,10016,39,"boogie nights is exceedingly well cast , and each of the actors rise to the occasion ; the ensemble cast is uniformly good .",pos
5,cv552,10016,40,"while most of the acting accolades will no doubt go to mr . wahlberg ( fulfilling upon the sparks of promise he demonstrated in some of his earlier films ) and mr . reynolds ( terrific as the father figure and stable anchor of the film , ringing true in every respect ) , a handful of other performances which might otherwise be overlooked deem mention .",pos
5,cv552,10016,41,"mr . reilly demonstrates here , as he did for brief glimpses in ulu grosbard's georgia , a genuine aptitude for comedy -- many of his scenes in boogie nights are among the very funniest in the film .",pos
5,cv552,10016,42,"i'm not sure how much of his performance as reed was scripted and how much was done on the spot , but he plays the quintessential second banana character to a tee .",pos
5,cv552,10016,43,"mr . reilly is the best part of the big disco dance production number , and it's wickedly funny to watch his reed join in with dirk after the fact in threatening the new stud on the block during a macho altercation .",pos
5,cv552,10016,44,"worth the price of admission alone is the glimpse of him getting down in the recording studio while the dirk character is laying down a numbingly bad ( and dead-on period ; it sure sounds like bad early 1980s to me ) demo track "" you got the touch "" in a vain attempt at a musical career .",pos
5,cv552,10016,45,mr . reilly plays his vacant character with utter conviction which is convincing and effective .,pos
5,cv552,10016,46,"ms . graham , with her long dirty blonde hair , innocent demeanour , and huge hazel eyes , looks like a disney animated heroine come to life -- or in this case , a disney animated heroine who came to life , made a wrong turn , and ended up on the new line lot in a film focused on the late 70s / early 80s adult film industry .",pos
5,cv552,10016,47,"consequently , it's a bit incongruous to see this cheery sweet-faced starlet whizzing about the set on her roller skates , but in a scene where she's lounging in a limousine prowling the streets , garish red lipstick messily smeared on , giving the camera a hilariously pouty come-hither look , all one can do is gulp .",pos
5,cv552,10016,48,her role in the film sadly needs more fleshing out ( err -- in a figurative sense ) -- she's essentially a glorified extra -- but she does score impressively in her key scene which is unnerving in its sheer primal ferocity .,pos
5,cv552,10016,49,"( if only mr . anderson had filmed the scene so that we could actually see the expression of rage and anguish on her face , though ! )",pos
5,cv552,10016,50,"and a cautionary tale for the strict and prudish : as a teen , ms . graham's parents forbade her to take a part in the twisted cult classic heathers ; since then , her most notable roles have been as a junkie ( gus van sant's drugstore cowboy ) and now a porn starlet .",pos
5,cv552,10016,51,draw your own conclusions .,pos
5,cv552,10016,52,"perhaps the most quietly touching performance in boogie nights is that of mr . cheadle , who lends dignity to his role as a character in search of his identity , and whose quest is comically manifested by a series of changes in his sense of fashion .",pos
5,cv552,10016,53,"his relationship with his cheerfully supportive new wife jessie st . vincent ( an interesting melora walters ) is wholly compelling has genuine sweetness , and although his general longing for acceptance from others is perceptible , it's no more so than in the bank scene where his loan application to open a stereo store is rejected due to his background in the porn industry .",pos
5,cv552,10016,54,"while the scenario is familiar , the wounded look in cheadle's eyes makes the scene unforgettable .",pos
5,cv552,10016,55,"luis guzman's most famous work is possibly in brian de palma's carlito's way , and here he plays a variation on the same character : maurice t . rodriguez is a hapless but good-natured nightclub owner who's a hanger-on to jack's group , ingratiating himself into the clique and constantly hounding jack , with little disguise made of his desperation , for a part in one of his erotic pictures .",pos
5,cv552,10016,56,jack's eventual acquiescence to maurice's request leads to one of boogie nights' biggest comic payoffs .,pos
5,cv552,10016,57,"boogie nights is a stunning achievement due to the virtuoso direction by mr . anderson , who immediately asserts his presence in the film industry as a presence of note with this work .",pos

5,cv553,26915,9,how exactly does one follow up on one of the biggest and most popular thrillers in recent years ?,pos
5,cv553,26915,10,"for shyamalan , the answer must have come as easy to him as nuclear physics does to kindergartners .",pos
5,cv553,26915,11,"does this new film measure up to his breakthrough box office smash , though ?",pos
5,cv553,26915,12,"the answer to that question is not a very easy one , either .",pos
5,cv553,26915,13,"as far as pacing goes , the sixth sense seemed almost interminable .",pos
5,cv553,26915,14,it wasn't until the surprise ending was revealed that i realized the film was actually intentionally ( and perfectly ) paced in order to give the audience ample time to re-connect all of the information they had seen once the climax had been reached .,pos
5,cv553,26915,15,"for unbreakable , shyamalan gave the film a much more satisfying pace which , in many ways , blows away the film that had come before .",pos
5,cv553,26915,16,"the story moves along at a steady pace and shyamalan's direction is excellent , with the camera almost constantly moving .",pos
5,cv553,26915,17,"there are tons of great shots in the film , not least of which is a conversation that opens the film between willis' character and another train passenger .",pos
5,cv553,26915,18,the shot seems as though it were filmed like we were watching the two talk from between the train seats and the camera steadily glides back and forth between the two actors as they speak .,pos
5,cv553,26915,19,"also very impressive is the film's score by james newton howard ( who also scored shyamalan's sixth sense and the similar film stir of echoes , as well as this year's dinosaur ) .",pos
5,cv553,26915,20,several of the scenes are driven by a very catchy beat and help to increase the tempo of the film .,pos
5,cv553,26915,21,"one of the best examples of this is a scene in which dunne goes into a train station to "" exercise "" his powers .",pos
5,cv553,26915,22,"the music , in combination with the stellar visuals , really go a long way towards making this an incredible movie .",pos

5,cv553,26915,24,"the film also boasts some great performances , including a precocious child actor trying to vie for the oscar throne left vacant by haley joel osment .",pos
5,cv553,26915,25,"willis turns in a great performance as the sad sack dunne , who just can't seem to figure out why he's been depressed for the last few years .",pos

5,cv553,26915,29,"robin wright penn's role seems slightly underwritten , but she still manages to get across the intense hurt of her character's need for love from her husband and her desire to make things work again .",pos

5,cv553,26915,32,"where the film does lose points though , is during its "" surprise "" ending .",pos
5,cv553,26915,33,"shyamalan has said in interviews that he was going to do an ending that blew away the one presented by the sixth sense , but i found myself saying "" that was it ? ! """,pos

5,cv553,26915,37,"essentially , what all of this means is that shyamalan has made another good film with unbreakable .",pos

5,cv553,26915,39,"as long as it isn't held to the standard that sixth sense set ( which it ultimately will be ) , it should be a remarkably well liked film .",pos

5,cv556,14808,7,"ironically , it was spielberg himself whose later commercial success would established new unwritten rules of "" blockubuster "" philosophy .",pos
5,cv556,14808,8,"but in the mid 1970s , many things were different ; spielberg was young and eager to use hollywood resources for his very personal and artistic movie .",pos
5,cv556,14808,9,"although very personal , spielberg's screenplay was partly based on the book "" ufo experience "" by dr . j . allen hynek and in many ways inspired by the popular urban mythology of extraterrestrial visitors to earth that began to grow in the world after ww2 .",pos
5,cv556,14808,10,"spielberg was not only inspired by the mythology , but his movie also gave the mythology itself a huge boost , unmatched until the contemporary era of x-files and the roswell anniversary .",pos
5,cv556,14808,11,that was partly because he made the movie very realistic using the authentic ufo-related incidents as the element of the plot .,pos
5,cv556,14808,12,the story begins with one of such incidents - team of international scientists come to the sonorra desert in mexico to find the u . s . navy planes of who went missing decades ago during the famous flight 19 .,pos
5,cv556,14808,13,"such events coincide with the ufo incident witnessed by roy neary ( richard dreyfuss ) , power company worker from muncie , indiana , who later becomes obsessed with his experience .",pos
5,cv556,14808,14,"because of his obsession he loses his job , family and sanity , but his loss is nothing compared to the experience of jillian guiler ( melinda dillon ) , single mother whose son becomes the victim of alien abduction .",pos
5,cv556,14808,15,"in the meantime , the scientists decipher the strange signals from outer space and u . s . government , in co-operation with the french , led by lacombe ( francois truffaut ) begin with the preparation for ultra-secret project .",pos
5,cv556,14808,16,"when the news of the poison gas leak in the middle of wyoming reach neary , he finally sees some sense in all his visions and begins the perilous journey toward the centre of endangered area .",pos
5,cv556,14808,17,there he is joined by jillian who shared the similar visions .,pos
5,cv556,14808,18,two of them must break through military pickets and reach their destination to find whatever is there .,pos
5,cv556,14808,19,spielberg here shows great mastery by using the very same techniques of jaws to make completely different effects .,pos
5,cv556,14808,20,"the slow , gradual yet very disciplined series of dramatic incidents - "" close encounters "" - is set in order to bring the viewer to the great revelation in the finale .",pos
5,cv556,14808,21,"but , instead of the fear and horror we had to endure during the jaws , we are now overwhelmed by the sense of boyish wonder .",pos
5,cv556,14808,22,"throughout the movie the viewer knows that something big , magnificent and wonderful is about to happen , and great magician spielberg delivers his promise in the end .",pos
5,cv556,14808,23,"the last sequence , with its , even in this age , impressive special effects by the great virtuoso douglas trumbull , would leave many mouths open .",pos
5,cv556,14808,24,one of the great virtues of this film is its optimism .,pos
5,cv556,14808,25,"aliens , who almost always get portrayed as the monsters in science-fiction cinema , are here benevolent and harmless creatures and the first contact between them and humanity is a beginning of something wonderful .",pos
5,cv556,14808,26,"it is very ironic , when we consider that the two classic sf movies that visually inspired spielberg actually told quite different story - howard hawks' thing and byron haskin's war of the worlds presented extraterrestrials as the threat to the mankind .",pos
5,cv556,14808,27,spielberg's humane approach and faith in the future also lies in great contrast to the pessimistic mood of its era ; the only hint of the contemporary gloom is post-watergate portrayal of government as conspiratorial towards the public .,pos
5,cv556,14808,28,"but , even such government is much more harmless compared to the murderous and chain-smoking men in black that became the stereotype thanks to x-files and its more cynical and disturbing visions .",pos
5,cv556,14808,29,"there lies the main , and probably the only flaw of this great picture - lack of conflict , and consequently , lack of drama .",pos
5,cv556,14808,30,"the movie has few excitements or even action scenes ( especially the last that may be an interesting homage to hitchcock's north by northwest ) but generally , almost everyone - neary , jillian , government , aliens - are the good guys .",pos
5,cv556,14808,31,"despite such shortcomings , the actors were good and manage to bring multidimensionality to their simple roles .",pos
5,cv556,14808,32,"richard dreyfuss is very convincing as a ordinary , yet nice guy , who sinks into insanity only to rediscover himself in a grand finale .",pos
5,cv556,14808,33,"melinda dillon was , on the other hand , nominated for "" oscar "" as a struggling mother , yet she was overshadowed by teri garr as neary's long-suffering wife ronnie .",pos
5,cv556,14808,34,"apart from visual wonders of this film , spielberg's semi-official composer john williams again excels by his beautiful music , this time using the simple melody both as the element of a plot , and as the basis for his score .",pos
5,cv556,14808,35,"the aliens , who are the main subject of this film , were visually very convincing .",pos
5,cv556,14808,36,"too convincing , one of my acquaintances in the ufo-researching circles said .",pos
5,cv556,14808,37,"according to him , the depiction of extraterrestrials as grey-skinned little people with big eyes was so accurate , that it managed to freak out powerful government figures interested in suppressing the truth about ufos .",pos
5,cv556,14808,38,"so , they later approached spielberg and ordered him to make another movie with alien , this time designed to be anything but the real life .",pos
5,cv556,14808,39,"the result was e . t . , for many years the biggest commercial hit of all times , yet less inspirational for ufo enthusiasts .",pos
5,cv556,14808,40,"anyway , whether the viewer believes in existence of extraterrestrials or ufos , close encounters of the third kind remains the great movie , and one of the rare uplifting experiences in modern cinema .",pos
5,cv557,11449,0,"with the exception of their surrealistic satire barton fink , the films of joel and ethan coen fit into two broad categories : quirky and sometimes darkly humorous takes on the "" film noir "" genre in which crime schemes go wrong and spin increasingly out of control ( fargo , miller's crossing , blood simple ) , and off-the-wall comedies centered around an eccentric , scatter-brained lead character ( raising arizona , the hudsucker proxy ) .",pos
5,cv557,11449,1,"their latest offering , the big lebowski , falls within the latter category , though there are elements of the crime-gone-wrong theme and even a touch of satire to be found in this film .",pos
5,cv557,11449,2,"the main difference , however , is that while the protagonists of raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy had lofty aspirations and ideals but didn't quite have the brains to get it all together , the main character of the big lebowski seems like a fairly intelligent guy who's wise to the world , but he doesn't really want to do much of anything besides go bowling , smoke pot , and generally relax .",pos
5,cv557,11449,3,"that main character is jeffrey "" the dude "" lebowski ( jeff bridges ) , introduced by the film's rambling narrator ( sam elliott ) as "" quite possibly the laziest man in los angeles county . """,pos
5,cv557,11449,4,"the dude is unemployed , needless to say , and spends most of his time at the bowling alley with his two best friends , walter ( john goodman ) , a borderline-psychotic who's in the habit of pulling a gun when he thinks somebody's cheating in a bowling match ( "" has the whole world gone crazy ? ! "" he shouts at a suspected cheater ) , and donny ( steve buscemi ) , who's always a few steps behind the conversation and is constantly berated by walter for it ( "" donny , you have no frame of reference here ! "" ) .",pos
5,cv557,11449,5,"these three seem to more or less live for bowling tournaments , and as the film begins they are anticipating an important match with rival bowler jesus quintana ( john turturro ) , who , when we first meet him , is doing a dance in the bowling lane to accompany a spanish version of "" hotel california "" and , if it's possible , seems to be even more of a head case than walter .",pos
5,cv557,11449,6,"if that doesn't give you a good idea of this film's absurdist tone , then perhaps this will : the entire scenario which drives the story is set in motion by two thugs mistakenly urinating on the dude's rug .",pos
5,cv557,11449,7,"they've mistaken him for a millionaire of the same name who is also known as the "" big "" lebowski ( david huddleston ) and whose nymphomaniac wife bunny ( tara reid ) owes money to porn producer jackie treehorn ( ben gazzara ) .",pos
5,cv557,11449,8,"the dude goes to the big lebowski seeking compensation for his ruined rug ; he doesn't have any luck , but when bunny is apparently kidnapped , the elder lebowski asks him to deliver the $1 million ransom .",pos
5,cv557,11449,9,"unfortunately , walter gets involved and fouls up the drop-off , and before they can try again to get the money to the supposed kidnappers , the dude's car gets stolen , along with the briefcase containing the money .",pos
5,cv557,11449,10,"soon , the dude is being harassed not only by the big lebowski himself but also by treehorn and by a group of german "" nihilists "" who demand the ransom money even though they may not have been involved in the kidnapping in the first place ; the dude and walter suspect that bunny may well have kidnapped herself in order to extort money from her husband to repay her debts to treehorn .",pos
5,cv557,11449,11,"meanwhile , the big lebowski's daughter maude ( julianne moore ) , a feminist avant-garde artist who likes to make grand entrances swinging through the air naked , wants to recover the money for her family .",pos
5,cv557,11449,12,"the plot , however , is really just a vehicle for all these bizarre characters to run wild and wreak their own unique forms of havoc .",pos
5,cv557,11449,13,"the previews for the big lebowski feature creedence clearwater revival's "" run through the jungle , "" and it fits : the coens see los angeles as a veritable jungle of oddballs and nutcases , with the sometimes bewildered dude left to run through it and try to avoid any more trouble ( usually unsuccessfully ) .",pos
5,cv557,11449,14,"the film doesn't feature quite as many one-liners and sight gags as the coens' other comedies ( though there are a few hilarious moments of visual humor , particularly in the dude's dream sequences and acid flashbacks ) , but it more than makes up for it with the sheer fun of watching these strange characters interact .",pos
5,cv557,11449,15,"the film sometimes seems a little disjointed as a result - you get the feeling that the coens have not only set their characters loose in this "" jungle "" but are also themselves running crazy through the jungle of their own twisted imaginations - but for the most part the characterizations are interesting enough to overcome the shaky plotting and what turns out to be a somewhat anticlimactic resolution .",pos
5,cv557,11449,16,"there's also a noticeable ( but not too heavy-handed ) thread of social commentary in the big lebowski , which , incidentally , takes place just as the gulf war is about to begin ; at the beginning , we see george bush on television making his "" this aggression will not stand "" speech .",pos
5,cv557,11449,17,"the coens take aim at just about every elite l . a . subculture in the book : the egotistical wealthy businessman ( "" the bums will always lose ! """,pos
5,cv557,11449,18,"shouts the big lebowski at one point ) , the porn industry , the overbearing malibu policeman who berates the dude for disturbing their "" peaceful beach community , "" and so on .",pos
5,cv557,11449,19,"by the end , we really start to admire the dude , who almost certainly harbors the least "" aggression "" of anyone in this story ; his passive resistance ( emphasis on "" passive , "" albeit ) to the elite emerges as something more than just another quirky characterization in a film overflowing with quirky characters .",pos
5,cv557,11449,20,"he also turns out to have a pretty well-functioning brain in his head , even if he doesn't like to use it very much ; his sarcasm towards treehorn and the malibu policeman shows that he knows when he's getting a run around , and he does manage to unravel the kidnapping mystery by the end .",pos
5,cv557,11449,21,"the coens certainly poke fun at the dude for his laziness , but they don't just treat him as fodder for cheap shots either .",pos
5,cv557,11449,22,"i think that , more than anything , is what makes the big lebowski a standout comedy : it manages to approach characters like the dude and , to some extent , walter , with genuine affection while still acknowledging that they are pretty scatter-brained .",pos
5,cv557,11449,23,"audience members may find themselves surprised at how much they like the un-dynamic duo by the end of the movie , given that they seemed like nothing more than the butts of an extended joke at first .",pos

5,cv560,17175,21,"we see him suffering from a personal crisis , and travolta does do a pretty good job in depicting his change of heart , but in the end , we don't fully believe it .",pos
5,cv560,17175,22,"and i think that the problem is when he has made his decision , the film choses an odd angle to go at , a noble one , but one that gives the film's conclusion that of incompleteness .",pos
5,cv560,17175,23,"in the opening of the film , we see him doing his old schtick , manipulating courts , winning cases effortlessly , and then discussing on a heard radio interview how great he is at his job and how much he cares for his cases .",pos
5,cv560,17175,24,"in short , he's full of bullshit and we know it .",pos
5,cv560,17175,25,"in the film , he takes a case that is hardly desired : a town where several of the children have died mysteriously of lukemia and the source of the illness seems to be from a local factory that may or may not have been dumping waste into the river .",pos
5,cv560,17175,26,"point one , it's not of the usual criteria ( jan points out , wickedly , that dead or wounded children aren't nearly as sympathetic as those struck down in the midst of their success ) .",pos
5,cv560,17175,27,"point two , it has been through several lawyers .",pos
5,cv560,17175,28,"after turning them down , jan changes his mind ( a muddled scene - he stops his car on a bridge , looks out . . . is he feeling a sense of overachievement ? ) , and he and his team of lawyers ( tony shalhoub , zeljko ivanek , and accountant william h . macy ) head out to the town to do battle with the town's company .",pos
5,cv560,17175,29,"they spend millions of dollars examining the land , test the water , what have you ( this is where stephen fry , a possible oscar nominee for his brilliant performance in "" wilde , "" pops up thanklessly ) , and in the meantime question the parents of the dead children , and then , unsuccessfully , the workers at the plant .",pos
5,cv560,17175,30,"they also find themselves clashing with a brilliant lawyer for the company , the eccentric jerome facher , played by robert duvall ( more on him later on ) .",pos
5,cv560,17175,31,"as we progress , we get so involved in the way the story is being told , which is engulfing everything around it , including the individual and brief stories of some of the townspeople ( one of the best is a bit with james gandolfini as an employee of the plant living across the street from kathleen quinland , who lost her child , who begins to have a personal crisis ) .",pos
5,cv560,17175,32,"things begin to go downhill for the lawyers in the second half , as they are up against impossible odds : the judge ( john lithgow ) is not only a strickler , but a pal of facher ; the employees of the plant are either afraid or to loyal to testify ; no concrete evidence is being found , depsite the money spent to find it ; and they are quickly running out of money .",pos
5,cv560,17175,33,"as macy mortgages everything he can , including their homes and their office , he slowly loses his sanity ( his meatiest role since , oh , "" fargo "" ) , and we the audience begin to feel a real loss of hope for our protagonist .",pos
5,cv560,17175,34,"in fact , the last half hour is such a change from the rest of the film and so unresolved that it has been widely panned as not being up to par ( owen gleiberman , especially , criticized the film for not being overly-dramatic . . . i",pos
5,cv560,17175,35,suppose like a grisham novel ) .,pos
5,cv560,17175,36,"this wouldn't be so if the change in jan had not been handled the way it is : instead of having a change of heart and automatically being perceived as good , he's seen as being still full of bullshit .",pos
5,cv560,17175,37,"because he doesn't take stock in the cares of his partners , and causes them all to lose their money and noteriaty in the lawyer field because he wants to help the people of the town , he is instead seen as being of good nature but not sure how to bring that out .",pos
5,cv560,17175,38,"the final half tries to redeem this , as must have been the point of making this in zallian's mind , but what follows is a series of scenes where we merely see him making personal stands for his beliefs , and though he has changed considerably from the opening moments when he's seen speeding back and forth from the town that wishes to employ him ( and thusly receiving two speeding tickets ) , we still feel that the big change in his life is that he's not rich and esteemed anymore ( the film's final title card is witty but in all actuality shallow ) .",pos
5,cv560,17175,39,"the fault is not that there is no closure to the court case ( it's still going on , you know ) , but that its personal story feels like it needs either another chapter or another angle in the final one it has .",pos
5,cv560,17175,40,"we need to feel like the character has really made a big change in his life , and that the story is how a story of strife like the one of the town could inspire such a whopping change in his personal life .",pos
5,cv560,17175,41,it only feels like half of that .,pos
5,cv560,17175,42,maybe even less .,pos
5,cv560,17175,43,"and it's not travolta , who does a great job here ( though never to be a truly memorable performance of his ) , but rather zallian , whose final chapter needs a rewrite .",pos
5,cv560,17175,44,"up to then , though , it's an engrossing drama , one of the best of the year in fact , and one of the best lawyer films , period .",pos
5,cv560,17175,45,"the reason is because it recognizes that a court trial is not about those being defended or prosecuted , but rather it's about the lawyers , the knights who battle eachother .",pos
5,cv560,17175,46,"we learn that the company is almost positively to blame for the deaths in the town , but the reason it can't be blamed is because it has the best prosecution you can find .",pos
5,cv560,17175,47,and duvall's facher is such a brilliant character and he does such a magnificent job at portraying that man that it's almost easy to overlook how subtley great he is .,pos
5,cv560,17175,48,"facher is seen as an elderly man , a goofy eccentric , carrying a broken brown bag with stickers on it , eating lunches out of paper bags , and making a point to take time out of his day to listen to the radio , and scold anyone who interupts him .",pos
5,cv560,17175,49,"but look deeper and you see a master at work : his evil and manipulative nature are hidden under the eccentricities that others don upon him , and it's difficult as hell to clearly generalize him in any way .",pos

5,cv563,17257,23,"we understand that joe adopts the fa ? ade of a cowboy , a symbol of virility and gallantry , as an attempt to neutralize his shame .",pos

5,cv575,21150,22,"this is one of those movies that you really do know what is going to happen , except you don't know how they are going to make it happen .",pos
5,cv575,21150,23,"it could be one way or another , it could be this way or that way .",pos
5,cv575,21150,24,the movie is highly stylized and extremely well-made .,pos
5,cv575,21150,25,it gets most of it's power from the two leads : ashley judd and tommy lee jones both give excellent performances .,pos
5,cv575,21150,26,the characters are well-realized and believable and we feel libby's pain when she cannot see her child for 6 years .,pos
5,cv575,21150,27,"even though a lot of critics didn't like the film , i loved it .",pos
5,cv575,21150,28,"the director took his time making the movie , and put a lot of shadowing in the movie .",pos

5,cv575,21150,30,"it moved at a fast pace , has suspense , humor , heart and great acting .",pos
5,cv575,21150,31,it earns it's right to be a great movie and to me that's what it was .,pos
5,cv576,14094,0,"as fairy tales go , cinderella has to be one of the most famous .",pos
5,cv576,14094,1,"almost everyone knows it , well at least in north america .",pos
5,cv576,14094,2,so it is natural that someone will try to make a movie out of it .,pos
5,cv576,14094,3,it has been done before with varying results .,pos
5,cv576,14094,4,this version of the story is both similar to the original and different at the same time .,pos
5,cv576,14094,5,"the basic story remains unchanged but , one thing that seems to vanish with this version , and that is all the fantastical elements of the story .",pos
5,cv576,14094,6,there is no fairy god mother or anything even remotely of that nature .,pos
5,cv576,14094,7,after the fantastical elements are stripped away what is left is a realistic believable rendition of the cinderella story and an interesting love story at the least .,pos
5,cv576,14094,8,.,pos
5,cv576,14094,9,"unlike in the fairy tale , the prince plays a much larger part than just that of the masked ball at the end .",pos
5,cv576,14094,10,"the ? prince' , who happens to be the crown prince to the throne of france , meets 'cinderella' , known as danielle , on a few occasions , most coincidentally and he becomes smitten with her .",pos
5,cv576,14094,11,although this seems to be a far cry from the traditional story it allows for the main plot to proceed with enough room for some imaginative story telling . .,pos
5,cv576,14094,12,"the story takes place in a renaissance setting ; in france , with leonardo da vinci providing some comic relief on more than one occasion .",pos
5,cv576,14094,13,"this addition of leonardo da vinci , was quite successful in that it added some color to the movie , since some of the roles are a bit stereotypical .",pos
5,cv576,14094,14,for example the role that was scripted for the prince leaves a few things to be desired .,pos
5,cv576,14094,15,"for instance the character seems to be a bit too unstable and fickle , a crown prince should not be anything remotely like that .",pos
5,cv576,14094,16,especially since he is portrayed to be in his mid twenties at the least and almost ready to take the throne .,pos
5,cv576,14094,17,"the characters of danielle ( cinderella ) played by drew barrymore , and that of the evil step mother , played by anjelica huston , are well developed and well played by the two women .",pos
5,cv576,14094,18,although the part of danielle is a bit stretched it is not too unlikely and not totally unbelievable .,pos
5,cv576,14094,19,the nuances of the character are brought out well by drew barrymore and from watching the movie it seems like she had fun making the movie .,pos
5,cv576,14094,20,as a contrast the part of the evil step mother is clearly seen from the very beginning and is almost clique .,pos
5,cv576,14094,21,"but , anjelica huston seems to add a certain flair to the role that makes it suit the movie nearly perfectly .",pos
5,cv576,14094,22,"the actual story is fairly predictable since it is after all the basic story of cinderella , but there are more than enough twists in how the story is told to make it interesting and enjoyable .",pos
5,cv576,14094,23,the acting is of high caliber and seems deserved of praise .,pos
5,cv576,14094,24,"all in all this movie takes you back into history , into a seemingly magical fairy land .",pos
5,cv576,14094,25,"but , don't get me wrong there is nothing but reality , it is just refreshing to watch a movie that is not based in a familiar setting with everyday familiar things happening .",pos
5,cv576,14094,26,"so although the story is basically familiar the world it is set in is not , and that adds a dimension to the film which in this humble reviewers opinion makes it worth seeing",pos
5,cv577,28549,0,"it stands as a moment one will not soon forget : a giant , green ogre flips through the pages of a cliche fairy tale , narrating it with every bit of dull inspiration that the story holds .",pos
5,cv577,28549,1,"this leads one to believe that this serves as the prologue to shrek , dreamworks' second computer animated feature , but in a pricelessly hilarious bit of cinema , a page of this tale serves as that ogre's toilet paper .",pos
5,cv577,28549,2,"from this opening moment , one can infer shrek's defying of all expectations regarding it as a standard , disney-esque fairy tale .",pos
5,cv577,28549,3,"although rampant moments of hilarity dot shrek , the true charm of the film lies in the bold elements of friendship , courage , and acceptance , excelled by outstanding direction , stunning actor voice work , and most importantly , a witty screenplay with more going on than meets the eye .",pos
5,cv577,28549,4,"while shrek features an abundance of humor related directly toward adults , positive friendship values aimed at younger children fulfill the storyline : shrek , the previously mentioned ogre , holds a position of absolute nothingness within his community .",pos
5,cv577,28549,5,"the jolly green giant meets a fellow outsider , known only as the donkey ( his species ) who talks , and although he remains reluctant to warm up to him for a good portion of time , shrek eventually comes to a mutual understanding with him by acknowledging their common state as outcasts of the world .",pos
5,cv577,28549,6,"the pair team up to retrieve princess fiona from a castle guarded by a dragon for the powerful lord farquaad , learning quite a bit about each other and themselves along the way .",pos
5,cv577,28549,7,"their friendship exhibits the core theme of the need for someone to lean on , exemplifying to any child who may witness the film that acting as an honest companion can unquestionably affect someone .",pos
5,cv577,28549,8,shrek and donkey endure as supposed freaks of nature due only to their differences from others but cling to each other for support and guidance along their journey .,pos
5,cv577,28549,9,"courage demonstrates itself within two major storylines : along the journey to rescue fiona , donkey's immeasurable cowardice reveals itself .",pos
5,cv577,28549,10,"whether he encounters walking over a shaky bridge or living alone , donkey withholds fears that he continuously puts aside without self-acknowledgment .",pos
5,cv577,28549,11,"but the yapping donkey must face his phobias when presented with the giant , fire-breathing dragon guarding fiona ; either he dies from terror or he triumphs with courage .",pos
5,cv577,28549,12,"he wisely chooses courage by pretending as if no dangerous situation actually faces him , allowing the donkey to overcome a horror that likely only continued due to his insistence of them .",pos
5,cv577,28549,13,"secondly , upon shrek's and donkey's redeeming of princess fiona , the ogre finds the princess has plans for whomever saves her : to satisfy her desire for a ( human ) knight in shining armor .",pos
5,cv577,28549,14,"throughout this storyline , shrek faces his deep , perpetual misgivings of inhering as an ogre and struggles to determine how he will reveal his true identity to fiona .",pos
5,cv577,28549,15,"an ongoing struggle occurs between himself and his reluctance of the truth , but eventually , shrek courageously conquers his fear by telling the forbidden secret to fiona .",pos
5,cv577,28549,16,"children can realize from donkey and shrek that fear remains only as complicated as one makes it ; if one sets his/her mind to overcoming something in particular , endless possibilities exist .",pos
5,cv577,28549,17,"after the friendships and courage prevail , the three central characters at the heart of shrek must take one more stretch of development : acceptance .",pos
5,cv577,28549,18,"surprisingly , fiona holds a dark secret of her own : due to a spell cast upon her years ago , she transforms into an ogre by night .",pos
5,cv577,28549,19,"in this storyline , fiona must learn to hold acceptance for herself , and she must realize what beauty truly means : to simply act as one's self .",pos
5,cv577,28549,20,"upon fiona's learning of shrek's desire to pursue a relationship with her , fiona , knowing that acceptance of herself serves as the only platform for her love with shrek to work , gives in to her inner demons of self-ridicule and hatred .",pos
5,cv577,28549,21,any child can pull from fiona's transformation the meaning of beauty and the meaning of self-acceptance .,pos
5,cv577,28549,22,"on the technical side , shrek triumphs .",pos
5,cv577,28549,23,"directors adam adamson and vicky jenson pace shrek in a consistent and satisfying manner , evenly distributing the lessons learned by the central characters .",pos
5,cv577,28549,24,"these central characters spring to life thanks to brilliant voice work from mike myers ( shrek ) , eddie murphy ( donkey ) , and cameron diaz ( princess fiona ) .",pos
5,cv577,28549,25,"myers creates his shrek as a lovable and troubled ogre whose green color not only serves as a skin color but perhaps his envy of other , "" normal "" beings .",pos
5,cv577,28549,26,murphy succeeds with his donkey through recreating the high-strung persona that so many know the actor to have off screen .,pos
5,cv577,28549,27,"cameron diaz exudes charisma and innocence as fiona , giving the princess/ogre a sense of power that many female characters in animated films lack .",pos
5,cv577,28549,28,"while the direction and voice work certainly elevate shrek , the ultimate factor in the film succeeding lies in the screenplay , written by ted elliott , terry rossio , joe stillman , and roger s . h .",pos

5,cv577,28549,30,"the script never underestimates the intelligence of the viewer , combining the three previously spoken of elements with humor for adults and children alike .",pos

5,cv582,6559,4,"the film unweaves its tale in a chronological order : we open with young and dirt-poor larry flynt and his brother jimmy , peddling jars of water in true entrepreneurial spirit out in the rural outback of kentucky .",pos

5,cv582,6559,7,"this evolved into the adult periodical _hustler_ magazine , creating larry flynt a vast financial empire , and the rest is history .",pos
5,cv582,6559,8,"what sets flynt apart from other publishers is his struggles against those who would have him cease publication of his adult material , and who railed and preached against him - flynt spent time in incarceration and was paralyzed by an assassination attempt - and his driven , single-minded insistence to buck the system and fight for his freedom of expression , regardless of personal cost .",pos

5,cv582,6559,12,larry flynt is surprisingly and wonderfully light-hearted and humourous .,pos
5,cv582,6559,13,"much of the comedy is elicited from larry flynt's outlandish stunts at his courtroom appearances - some of his chosen apparel is hilarious - and for the most part these elements of the film work far better than some of the more dramatic points , such as an uninspiring flynt monologue set at a free speech rally in front of an enormous american flag dealing with the subjectivity of obscenity .",pos
5,cv582,6559,14,"the film's focus is on the flynt's many battles over first amendment rights and freedom of speech , but the heart of the people vs .",pos
5,cv582,6559,15,larry flynt is the touching love story between flynt and althea .,pos
5,cv582,6559,16,"larry flynt is shown as being occassionally gruff , harsh , and overtly aggressive with his friends and colleagues , but with althea , we see his loving , affectionate side .",pos
5,cv582,6559,17,there's a scene where flynt tenderly takes his ill wife on a ride on his wheelchair that is heartbreaking .,pos
5,cv582,6559,18,"ultimately , the emotional power that the film hits at its conclusion comes not from his achievements from his battles against censors , but from the strength of flynt and althea's love for each other .",pos
5,cv582,6559,19,woody harrelson is entirely engaging in what must be certainly a career-topping performance as the irrepressible larry flynt .,pos
5,cv582,6559,20,"harrelson plays flynt with the right mixture of outrageousness and confident stubborness to make him endearing and entirely sympathetic to the audience , and a very compelling protagonist for the film .",pos
5,cv582,6559,21,"courtney love plays althea leasure in a startling turn , completely raw and impulsive .",pos
5,cv582,6559,22,"it's a very solid performance , brash and naturalistic , and love is extremely compelling ; it's difficult to take your eyes off her onscreen , and her chemistry with harrelson is dead-on .",pos

5,cv582,6559,24,"larry flynt , much as his counterpart lawyer alan isaacman was upstaged by flynt during many of the courtroom scenes , but norton shines in his big scene where he addresses the supreme court in the climactic scene of the film .",pos
5,cv582,6559,25,"one can sense the frustration that norton's character feels when harrelson's free-talking flynt sabotages trial after trial on him by openly speaking his mind , and this results in a heightened emotional punch when norton's isaacman has the opportunity to sway the supreme court judges .",pos
5,cv582,6559,26,"milos forman keeps the film moving - although it runs over two hours , it never drags - and his direction of the film is very effective , eliciting a great deal of empathy for a subject which could be construed by some as extremely sordid and unsympathetic .",pos
5,cv582,6559,27,"there's also a great visual technique which forman uses to indicate the passing of time in one shot , which is both clever and extremely entertaining .",pos

5,cv582,6559,29,"larry flynt is in a rush to get to its main theme , with flynt battling against authorities and the system for his freedom of speech .",pos
5,cv582,6559,30,"consequently , the first thirty minutes of the film , introducing and setting up the characters , seem unduly rushed ; perhaps it is merely due to the fact that these characters are so interesting , but i felt it would have worked better if this route was taken in a more leisurely fashion .",pos
5,cv582,6559,31,"it also felt like there was a distinctive lack of insight into the inner workings of these characters - the film clearly shows what flynt , althea , isaacman , and rev . jerry faldwell did , and on a superficial level some of their motivations , but it never seemed like one could really understand the characters on a deeper level .",pos
5,cv582,6559,32,"for example , why larry flynt was compelled by ruth carter stapleton ( president carter's sister ) to be born-again is a mystery to me .",pos

5,cv582,6559,36,"larry flynt is certainly among the very best studio-released films of 1996 , and works both as a ringing political statement about the importance of freedom of speech and the depths to which larry flynt would go to advance the cause of free expression , and as a touching love story .",pos

5,cv597,26360,12,"this new audience was prone to dressing up like the characters from the film , acting out segments in front of the screen as the movie played , yelling rude comments at the screen , and just generally having a good time .",pos
5,cv597,26360,13,word quickly spread about this new phenomena of interactive film and the rocky horror picture show's life as the ultimate cult film was born .,pos
5,cv597,26360,14,"for the virgins out there who are unaware , the plot centers around a loving couple , brad majors ( barry bostwick ) and janet weiss ( susan sarandon ) , who come from a small town called denton .",pos
5,cv597,26360,15,brad and janet have just attended the wedding of two of their friends and decide that they also want to be wed .,pos
5,cv597,26360,16,"they plan a trip to see the man who led to their meeting , dr . everett scott ( jonathan adams , who played the narrator in the original stage version ) , but their car gets a flat on the way to his home .",pos
5,cv597,26360,17,"remembering a castle they had seen back a few miles down the road , they decide to walk there and see if the residents have a phone they might be able to use to call for assistance .",pos
5,cv597,26360,18,"the castle is actually the home of a race of aliens from the planet transsexual ( in the galaxy of transylvania ) , who are lead by the eccentric fishnet-stocking wearing mad scientist dr . frank-n-furter ( tim curry ) .",pos
5,cv597,26360,19,frank-n-furter has masterminded the secret to creating life and has done so in the form of rocky ( peter hinwood ) .,pos
5,cv597,26360,20,"as rocky becomes accustomed to his new environment , brad and janet find themselves at the mercy of frank-n-furter's mad schemes .",pos
5,cv597,26360,21,"little do any of them know that the doctor's handyman , riff-raff ( original author richard o'brien ) , and domestic , magenta ( patricia quinn ) , are actually transsexual planetary protectors who have been sent to stop frank from spreading his alien evil all over the earth .",pos
5,cv597,26360,22,"going back and revisiting this film after ten years ( 1990 being the first time i had ever seen it ) , it is amazing to me that this film ever got made or has had the staying power that it has .",pos
5,cv597,26360,23,"if i had been a fox executive around the time of its release , i don't think i would have known what to make of it either .",pos
5,cv597,26360,24,"for all intents and purposes it is a bad movie ( though bad in a really good sort of way ) , but sumptuous production design and a great deal of incredibly catchy songs really help to increase the likability of the film .",pos
5,cv597,26360,25,"by the time the credits role , it is fairly easy to have gotten wrapped up in the film and its characters , and one really gets the feeling that richard o'brien definitely was a fan of the old cheesy b-movies his film is based on .",pos
5,cv597,26360,26,"when i say that the wall-to-wall songs are catchy what i really mean to say is that , once you hear them , they will be ingrained in your head for all of eternity .",pos
5,cv597,26360,27,"it goes without saying that the "" time warp "" is the most popular song in the film .",pos
5,cv597,26360,28,even people who have never seen the movie know of that particular song .,pos
5,cv597,26360,29,"what those who haven't seen the movie don't know though , is that there are even more songs in the film that are just as worthy of acknowledgment .",pos
5,cv597,26360,30,"my personal favorite is "" over at the frankenstein place "" , but "" dammit janet "" is also maddeningly catchy .",pos
5,cv597,26360,31,"tim curry's vocals on the rocking tune "" sweet transvestite "" need to be heard to be believed .",pos
5,cv597,26360,32,"the finale of the film , a big floor show staged by frank-n-furter and featuring most of the cast in garters and fishnets ( including barry bostwick . . .",pos
5,cv597,26360,33,"frightening ! ) , features no less than four songs ( "" rose tint my world "" , "" don't dream it "" , "" wild and untamed thing "" , and "" i'm going home "" ) , all of which are immensely singable .",pos
5,cv597,26360,34,the film's true popularity and longevity resides in its audience participation though .,pos
5,cv597,26360,35,"despite the catchiness of the songs , this movie would have been long forgotten about if it hadn't have been for the multitude of folks who dress up every friday or saturday night to rush out and be a part of their own little floor show .",pos
5,cv597,26360,36,watching this film at home is nothing compared to actually experiencing this in a theater with hundreds of rabid fans ( unless you don't mind inviting friends over and letting them shoot water guns in your home or letting them throw rice and pieces of toast all over the place ) .,pos
5,cv597,26360,37,"note : director jim sharman brought back to the central characters of the film , in the form of a sequel , resulting in the very much forgotten film shock treatment , which picks up with brad and janet ( this time played by cliff de young and jessica harper ! ) as contestants on a game show in their home town of denton .",pos
5,cv597,26360,38,"the two are menaced by the evil tv station manager ( also played by de young ) , who wishes to claim janet as his own .",pos
5,cv597,26360,39,"o'brien returned as a writer/performer on the project ( as did quinn , campbell , and gray in performance capacity only ) , but the film had nowhere near the spirit of the original .",pos

5,cv597,26360,41,"as a lasting testament to the longevity of the film and its legion of fans , a brand new special edition 2-disc dvd set has been released that is the most comprehensive compendium of rocky horror to date ( even out shining the laserdisc special edition that was released for its 20th anniversary ) .",pos
5,cv597,26360,42,"if you are one of those people who can't get enough of the film , this disc should be more than enough to satisfy your appetites .",pos
5,cv597,26360,43,"in an attempt to recreate the interactivity of the film , fox home entertainment has released this wonderful 2-disc dvd set loaded with so many extras that it'll take a good eight hours just to take in the majority of it all .",pos
5,cv597,26360,44,the film itself is located on the first disc and has been given a beautiful transfer that shows it in its original aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 ( enhanced for 16x9 televisions ) .,pos
5,cv597,26360,45,"the film is presented in two different versions , the us theatrical version and the uk version which adds a musical number during the finale called "" superheroes "" .",pos
5,cv597,26360,46,"for ambitious viewers , the disc also includes a hidden version ( located on the main menu by clicking left from the scene selection menu choice and highlighting a pair of lips in the lower left corner ) which presents the film in the manner it was originally supposed to have been seen .",pos
5,cv597,26360,47,"originally , the film was to have been similar to the wizard of oz , with the first half of the it seen in black and white ( and not changing to color until the transylvanians are first revealed to brad and janet during the time warp musical number ) .",pos
5,cv597,26360,48,"most reports , including a documentary on the disc , say that the color was supposed to appear when frank-n-furter first shows up in the elevator , but it does seem to work better where it was placed on this version , depicting the vast difference between the world brad and janet were used to compared with the one to which they are introduced .",pos
5,cv597,26360,49,"the film contains a commentary track by show creator ( and faithful handyman ) richard o'brien and co-star patricia quinn which is fairly enjoyable ( and quinn immediately starts off by refusing to speak about sarandon nearly contracting pneumonia while having to walk around wet and half-naked on freezing cold sets , which she apparently complained about the entire film and in future interviews ) .",pos
5,cv597,26360,50,"the two seem like old friends and have great stories to tell , but they also point out cast members that are sadly no longer with us anymore ( and there are quite a few ) .",pos
5,cv597,26360,51,fox has also tried to recreate the feel of attending the film in a theater with several audience participation segments .,pos
5,cv597,26360,52,the first feature ( and the most simple ) is a subtitle prompter which lets you know when to open up on people with your water guns or when the right time to throw your toast is .,pos
5,cv597,26360,53,"the second feature is an audience participation track , which lets you in on what you might hear on a good night out at the show .",pos
5,cv597,26360,54,"most of the comments are unintelligible because it is basically just a large group of people screaming their heads off , but every once and a while a comment can be heard that will invoke a bit of laughter .",pos
5,cv597,26360,55,"the final participation segment uses a technology very much like the technology used on the matrix dvd , where a pair of lips will appear on-screen during certain scenes of the film ( mostly during the musical numbers ) that can be selected by pressing enter on your remote .",pos
5,cv597,26360,56,"when selected , you will be taken out of the film and into a live participation version of the scene put on during one of the many screenings that occur all over the world .",pos
5,cv597,26360,57,"once the segment is over , you are deposited right back into the film where you left off .",pos
5,cv597,26360,58,the first disc also contains a few dvd-rom goodies for those with that particular type of dvd player .,pos
5,cv597,26360,59,"there is a timeline of the evolution from the stage play version to worldwide cult sensation , a video jukebox , a you don't know jack-styled trivia game ( which is about as bare bones a you don't know jack parody as it can be ) , and a bizarre mad-libs styled word game known as riff-raff's story lab .",pos
5,cv597,26360,60,links to the rocky horror websites are also available from the dvd-rom portion of the disc .,pos

5,cv599,20988,6,that might also be part of the reason why his moralizing comes across as so heavy-handed .,pos

5,cv599,20988,12,"changing the minds of the dogmatic is virtually impossible , and since the dogmatic believe that they have special insight , they also know what is best for you , whether you like it or not .",pos

5,cv599,20988,14,smith's own problem with delivering this message is that he beats us over the head with it like we are reading a dogma for dummies book .,pos
5,cv599,20988,15,"but this is smith's personality , and his simplistic views neglect such adult issues as how does one interpret the bible ( or koran , etc . ) correctly ( or if there even is a correctly ) and how one settles disputes of heretofore dogmatic concerns .",pos

5,cv599,20988,25,the film's humor is uneven .,pos
5,cv599,20988,26,some parts are very funny as when bethany goes for a fire extinguisher when metatron makes a burning-bush kind of entrance .,pos
5,cv599,20988,27,"but many of the film's jokes just bomb , as in virtually anything involving salma hayek's serendipity .",pos

6,cv600,23878,56,"ghost dog is reticent to speak , often going for long periods without doing so .",pos
6,cv600,23878,57,the fact that whitaker can convey such a wide range of emotion through a gesture or look is a remarkable talent .,pos
6,cv600,23878,58,"although the film has a deliberate pace , some of the late night drives and walks taken by ghost dog dragged the momentum down .",pos
6,cv600,23878,59,truly tragic is how ghost dog misinterprets japanese honor in his final confrontation with the mob .,pos
6,cv600,23878,60,he reveals himself to be so desperate for spiritual guidance through the hagakure that he fails to truly adapt it to what is real and true in his world .,pos

6,cv601,23453,1,for anyone wishing to have the same experience i would suggest reserving judgement of the movie until viewing it in its entirety .,pos
6,cv601,23453,2,that is no easy task .,pos
6,cv601,23453,3,"superficially , it bears an unfortunate ( and not necessarily unintended ) resemblance to several other movies , notably "" return to paradise "" and "" midnight express . """,pos
6,cv601,23453,4,"as a result nearly every review of "" brokedown palace "" i subsequently read became hopelessly entangled in making the obvious comparisons .",pos
6,cv601,23453,5,"the consequence was nearly universal condemnation , which is a shame as this is a fine film .",pos
6,cv601,23453,6,"for those who have yet to view the movie , let me say that it is not an attempt to portray the nightmarish reality of the third world criminal justice system ( as was "" midnight express "" ) nor completely the moral dilemma and examination of the meaning of friendship and humanity that was the heart of "" return to paradise . """,pos
6,cv601,23453,7,"in my view , if this film is to be compared to any other source it would have to be joseph conrad's acclaimed novel , "" lord jim . """,pos
6,cv601,23453,8,"problematically , the basic storyline seems more than familiar : two american teenage girls on vacation are sentenced to spend most of their lives in a thai prison for drug smuggling in an obvious set-up involving a suave con-man , a shadowy criminal conspiracy and a corrupt third world "" justice "" system .",pos
6,cv601,23453,9,the girls are alice ( claire danes ) and darlene ( kate beckinsale ) .,pos
6,cv601,23453,10,"they're life-long buddies who planned a high-school graduation trip to hawaii , and then secretly changed their destination to the more exotic thailand without telling their parents .",pos
6,cv601,23453,11,"once there , they find a $6 hotel and go sight-seeing , which includes sneaking into a luxury hotel to sip expensive drinks poolside .",pos
6,cv601,23453,12,"they get caught trying to charge the bill to the wrong room , a minor transgression which will later come back to haunt them , but they are saved from hotel security by a charming , friendly australian , nick ( daniel lapaine ) , who takes care of the bill with a more polished execution of the girl's scam .",pos
6,cv601,23453,13,"he then proceeds to separate the girls and make smooth moves , first toward alice , then toward darlene .",pos
6,cv601,23453,14,by now alarm bells are going off among viewers .,pos
6,cv601,23453,15,"the ever-present nick is too slick and his stories don't add up ( to us ) --the girls , of course , are too naive to notice .",pos
6,cv601,23453,16,"long before it happens , we're anticipating the inevitable disappearance of the fast-talking smuggler and the arrest of our teenaged sitting-ducks at the airport en route to hong kong caught holding the bag ( literally ) containing heroin .",pos
6,cv601,23453,17,"just as predictably , the thai police and courts do their part in meting out injustice and our trusting tourists are prison-bound for a long stretch .",pos
6,cv601,23453,18,left unanswered is the red herring issue of whether one or the other of the girls was a willing accomplice .,pos
6,cv601,23453,19,"for those in need of a ready answer , might i suggest closer scrutiny of the bell hop at the girl's fleabag hotel .",pos
6,cv601,23453,20,"as one door after another to their comfortable former life is closed , the girls and their families turn in desperation to the noiresque expatriate lawyer/fixer "" yankee hank "" ( bill pullam ) and his thai-born partner-wife .",pos
6,cv601,23453,21,"a recurring element of the movie is the tension between appearance and reality as expressed in one of the film's tag lines , "" who do you trust ? , "" and hank is no exception although seasoned movie- goers and those familiar with pullman's oeuvre will find few surprises .",pos
6,cv601,23453,22,much of the remainder of the movie is a smorgasbord of intriguing themes incompletely explored in short-hand fashion .,pos
6,cv601,23453,23,"lou diamond phillips , for instance , plays a delightfully sinister and callous dea agent who , while appearing to be casually accommodating to hank , withholds vital information at crucial moments .",pos
6,cv601,23453,24,is he part of a wider conspiracy ?,pos
6,cv601,23453,25,"with an inherently powerful , if somewhat tired premise , the film offers by parts a riveting courtroom drama , a prison story , and a potential character study of american teens , their relationship , and what constitutes friendship between them .",pos
6,cv601,23453,26,"the result is reasonably engaging and suspenseful , with the girls' interaction , hank's investigation , and the various trials and hearings , offering hope for their release , delivering tension--as does the foredoomed possibility of their escape .",pos
6,cv601,23453,27,"if "" brokedown palace "" has a major flaw , it is its creators' tendency , like time-constrained tourists , to take frequent side trips down fascinating alleys only to reverse direction half-way down and return to the story's main avenue .",pos
6,cv601,23453,28,"and , if that were all there was to "" brokedown palace , "" it wouldn't be a very good movie .",pos
6,cv601,23453,29,"but i believe the writers and director were after bigger game and , in this , they succeeded .",pos
6,cv601,23453,30,"for the main theme of the movie , like the proffered name of its location , is freedom--in all its permutations .",pos
6,cv601,23453,31,"ultimately , the other sub-themes may be considered window dressing .",pos
6,cv601,23453,32,"young and pretty , alice ( danes ) is an old soul ; a wild , streetwise teenager with a thirst for freedom and adventure .",pos
6,cv601,23453,33,"presented as a perfect blend of yin and yang , dark and light , is her cautious best friend , darlene ( beckinsale ) .",pos
6,cv601,23453,34,"clear-eyed and straightforward , alice is more complex than her friend .",pos
6,cv601,23453,35,"she comes from a poorer background , has a reputation for getting into trouble and has lost the trust of everyone ( including her own father ) .",pos
6,cv601,23453,36,"whereas darlene's life is "" on-track , "" aimed at college , marriage , kids , a career , a suburban home , middle age and "" fulfillment , "" alice's is uncertain , unfocused , and yearning .",pos
6,cv601,23453,37,"one poignant scene in the film shows darlene shouting across an open moat to visitors--friends and relatives from home , whose lives continue while hers is in limbo .",pos
6,cv601,23453,38,"tellingly , alice is present but not included .",pos
6,cv601,23453,39,"just as revealing of their different personalities , when alice and dar first come to thailand , the openness and delight on alice's face doesn't read as simple naivet ? ; the way she stands up and stretches as she and her friend ride along in a small boat , reaching toward the sun , she really is drinking in what she believes to be freedom , while "" dar "" remains seated in the shade .",pos
6,cv601,23453,40,""" brokedown palace "" begins with an admission by alice of her guilt in a tape recording sent to hank .",pos
6,cv601,23453,41,"however unintentional , it's all alice's fault .",pos
6,cv601,23453,42,"she's responsible for persuading her friend to lie to her parents , to sneak away from the safety of hawaii to the perils of thailand , to try the petty scam which places them in the clutches of the evil nick .",pos
6,cv601,23453,43,"( in case one misses this point in the inevitable confusion of a film's beginning , darlene obligingly reminds alice of her culpability in prison . )",pos
6,cv601,23453,44,"dar , of course , is the willing dupe which , in her view , confers innocence .",pos
6,cv601,23453,45,never mind that it was her coercion of a reluctant alice to accompany her to hong kong which placed them in police custody in the first place or that her naive confession sealed their fate .,pos
6,cv601,23453,46,dar is innocent .,pos

6,cv601,23453,49,she and her journey toward personal freedom .,pos
6,cv601,23453,50,along the way we are treated to an unsympathetic portrait of the shallow american culture which created these girls with their half-baked sensibilities and materialistic goals .,pos
6,cv601,23453,51,"in the end , that culture , like its representatives , "" yankee "" hank and dar's father ( a "" man who knows how to grease the wheels "" ) , proves as impotent as its government in the face of the girl's tragedy .",pos
6,cv601,23453,52,"thailand's culture , contrary to most opinion , comes off much better by comparison .",pos
6,cv601,23453,53,it amazes me that reviewers argued this point at both extremes .,pos
6,cv601,23453,54,i believe the filmmaker's view was that thai culture is vastly different from the american but not necessarily inferior .,pos
6,cv601,23453,55,the thai ( with the sole exceptions of a corrupt official and a spiteful prison spy ) were uniformly consistent in their behavior and true to their principles .,pos
6,cv601,23453,56,the girls were shown to be treated no better but certainly no worse than the native-born .,pos
6,cv601,23453,57,"their prison ( in stark contrast to the probable reality ) was no hellhole , being relatively clean and sunlit .",pos
6,cv601,23453,58,"the prison authorities demanded good hygiene , provided medical care when needed , and "" hard manual labor "" consisted of picking grass !",pos
6,cv601,23453,59,the thai guards were authoritarian ( what else ? ) but certainly not routinely sadistic .,pos
6,cv601,23453,60,"as for the thai justice system , the reasoning of the thai judges , during both an appeal hearing and in the film's penultimate scene was devastating in its logic and morality .",pos
6,cv601,23453,61,"'freedom' has many faces and "" brokedown palace "" explores many of them .",pos
6,cv601,23453,62,"in the extreme , we have freedom of the body and freedom of the spirit .",pos
6,cv601,23453,63,some settle for the former alone while others remain imprisoned with an entire nation to roam without the latter .,pos
6,cv601,23453,64,but freedom seldom comes without a price .,pos
6,cv601,23453,65,"which is why the movie's other tag lines are : "" what is your dream ? """,pos

6,cv601,23453,69,i think the light bathing only her figure among the assembled prisoners in the final scene visually signals that fact .,pos
6,cv601,23453,70,"kate beckinsale's character might more properly be likened to the "" released "" temple bird referred to twice during the film , "" trained to fly back to its cage . """,pos

6,cv601,23453,75,"in reading the many user's comments , i was struck by what seems an unusual phenomenon : whether or not a person liked the movie , almost everyone praised the actors .",pos

6,cv602,8300,8,"when it was first released , it literally shocked the audiences .",pos

6,cv604,2230,0,brian depalma needs a hit * really * badly .,pos
6,cv604,2230,1,"since scoring big with the untouchables in 1987 , depalma has seen casualties of war , raising cain and particularly the disastrous bonfire of the vanities go down in flames .",pos
6,cv604,2230,2,"consequently , it would be easy enough to consider carlito's way a shrewd commercial choice for depalma , reteaming with al pacino ( scarface ) and returning to the gangland ground which has yielded his two greatest box office successes .",pos
6,cv604,2230,3,it doesn't hurt any that he has latched on to a solid story and brought out dynamite performances from pacino and sean penn .,pos
6,cv604,2230,4,"carlito's way , while hampered by depalma's characteristic excesses and stylistic cannibalism , is a truly tense and engrossing drama .",pos
6,cv604,2230,5,carlito brigante ( pacino ) is a life-long criminal who finds himself unexpectedly given a second chance .,pos
6,cv604,2230,6,"in 1975 , carlito is released from prison after serving only five years of a thirty year sentence when his conviction is overturned on a technicality .",pos
6,cv604,2230,7,"he declares himself reformed , tired of life on the streets and determined to fulfill his simple dream of buying into a rental car business in the bahamas .",pos
6,cv604,2230,8,"among those who find this conversion hard to believe are david kleinfeld ( penn ) , carlito's crooked attorney and childhood friend , and bodyguard pachanga ( luis guzman ) .",pos
6,cv604,2230,9,"carlito rediscovers old flame gail ( penelope ann miller ) , and seems ready to retire in peace .",pos
6,cv604,2230,10,"old ways die hard , though , and old associates pull carlito step by step back into a life he can't seem to shake .",pos
6,cv604,2230,11,carlito's way will probably make the strongest impression with the two outstanding set pieces which bracket the film .,pos
6,cv604,2230,12,"in the first , carlito accompanies his young cousin on a drug buy which will have anyone with a pulse on the edge of their seat ; the film closes with an equally thrilling chase through the new york subway and grand central station .",pos
6,cv604,2230,13,"both highlight depalma's gift for choreographed mayhem , and these are not the only occasions when the stage blood flows freely .",pos
6,cv604,2230,14,"yet for all the viscera , i found the character study even more compelling .",pos
6,cv604,2230,15,"carlito brigante has a lot of michael corleone in him , an aging gangster trying unsuccessfully to go legit .",pos
6,cv604,2230,16,"but where the culmination of the godfather saga played like opera , there's more of an immediacy to carlito's way , an ever-present sense of doom launched by the title sequence which sets the flashback story in motion .",pos
6,cv604,2230,17,"you sense that there's no way , after so many years , that carlito can stay out of trouble .",pos
6,cv604,2230,18,"indeed , he observes that his attempt at the straight life is more a function of time than a change of heart : "" you don't get reformed ; you just run out of wind . """,pos
6,cv604,2230,19,pacino captures carlito's dilemma with surprising subtlety and the cautious observation borne of years of experience watching every corner for an enemy .,pos
6,cv604,2230,20,"sean penn is even better , turning in his best performance to date as kleinfeld .",pos
6,cv604,2230,21,"a jew in the world of puerto rican and italian wiseguys , kleinfeld is an outsider with a huge chip on his shoulder .",pos
6,cv604,2230,22,"he could have been simply pathetic , a heavy drinker and cocaine addict playing tough with guys way out of his league , but penn invests kleinfeld with tremendous nervous energy and an overwhelming survival instinct .",pos
6,cv604,2230,23,"he shows a man moving steadily towards the brink , making the moment he goes over quite jolting .",pos
6,cv604,2230,24,"as compelling as the narrative is , viewers may experience a profound sense of deja vu .",pos
6,cv604,2230,25,"depalma continues to steal shamelessly from other directors , this time adding scorsese to his repertoire with a point of view tracking shot and a copacabana scene with more than passing resemblances to goodfellas .",pos
6,cv604,2230,26,"he even recycles some of his own previous plagiarisms , like a 360 degree swing around a kiss ( vertigo via body double ) and the climactic shootout which will strike many as far too reminiscent of the train station sequence from the untouchables .",pos
6,cv604,2230,27,"from a story standpoint , there's an obligatory love story with a cliche'd long-suffering girlfriend character .",pos
6,cv604,2230,28,"penelope ann miller is a good but limited actor who doesn't do anything new with the role , and eventually she becomes just a distraction , never integrated fully enough into the story .",pos
6,cv604,2230,29,"still , it's easier to be forgiving of superficial flaws when the backbone is so solid .",pos
6,cv604,2230,30,"the two principle characters held an iron grip on my attention , one all the cinematic thievery in the world couldn't break .",pos
6,cv604,2230,31,"carlito's way plays like a tragic novel : deliberate , confident and powerful .",pos
6,cv604,2230,32,those willing to grant depalma his tendencies towards the extreme should find themselves well- rewarded .,pos
6,cv605,11800,0,"i've never been a huge fan of jeff bridges , but i loved him in the big lebowski .",pos
6,cv605,11800,1,"the part of jeff "" the dude "" lebowski was reportedly written specifically with bridges in mind , and the fit is perfect .",pos

6,cv605,11800,8,"dude and his friend walter ( john goodman ) take on the task , and get caught in an intricate web of kidnapers , millionaires , high schoolers , nihilists , artists , pornographers , thugs , and league bowlers .",pos
6,cv605,11800,9,"comedy is perhaps the most subjective of genres , so take my recommendation as you will : for me , the big lebowski is very funny .",pos
6,cv605,11800,10,"it is an incredibly successful comedy , the ratio of laughs to intended jokes much higher than in most films .",pos
6,cv605,11800,11,"not only are the two leads ( bridges and goodman ) funny separately and together , but each supporting character is a refreshing comic figure .",pos
6,cv605,11800,12,"all the characters end up as the butt of jokes , but the jokes are always deserved and never contrived .",pos
6,cv605,11800,13,"each person may be a comic caricature , but there is always a respectful self-acceptance that lets us laugh at these people without condescension .",pos
6,cv605,11800,14,"the characters are firmly established , and they never change their behavior for a quick , cheap laugh .",pos
6,cv605,11800,15,"it's not what they do that's funny , it's who they are , which is why the acting is so important , and so successful , in this movie .",pos
6,cv605,11800,16,"worth mentioning are john turturro as jesus ( that's jee-zus , not hay-soos ) , the greaser bowler who's in a lusty marriage with the game ; julianne moore as the post-post-feminist artist whose work has been described as "" vaginal ; "" steve buscemi as the eager tagalong bowler who is constantly rebuked and ignored by teammates dude and walter ; and sam elliott as the rambling , long-winded narrator .",pos
6,cv605,11800,17,"aside from the performances , what makes all the characters funny and interesting is the astute dialogue .",pos
6,cv605,11800,18,"people lose trains of thought , they interrupt , they boast , they repeat themselves , they repeat their friends . . .",pos
6,cv605,11800,19,they sound natural .,pos
6,cv605,11800,20,"taken with fargo , the coen brothers' last film , it is evidence that the brothers are observant listeners and gifted writers .",pos
6,cv605,11800,21,"ethan coen is not just good at directing actors , he's also good at technical directing .",pos
6,cv605,11800,22,he and cinematographr roger deakins created a beautiful world on film .,pos
6,cv605,11800,23,"perhaps "" beautiful "" is the wrong word ; nihilists , carpet-pissers and thugs are not objects of beauty .",pos
6,cv605,11800,24,"but the bowling photography and a series of viking/bowling fantasy dream sequences are lovingly photographed , as though the dude himself were in charge of immortalizing them on film .",pos

6,cv606,15985,1,"the enterprise crew , in the meantime , experience the rejuvenating qualities of the ba'ku homeworld : lt . worf grows a pimple , data sings opera pieces , picard scores with a ba'ku chick , riker shaves while sharing a bubblebath with troi , and the enterprise women note their firmer breasts .",pos
6,cv606,15985,2,"comments : "" star trek : the next generation "" was a hugely successful sequel tv series to "" star trek , "" a science fiction series which developed a devoted fan following in the 1970s .",pos
6,cv606,15985,3,"even though it still enjoyed high ratings , "" star trek : the next generation "" ended production after seven years so that the cast could replace the original "" star trek "" 's cast in paramount's film franchise centering on the voyages of the starship enterprise .",pos
6,cv606,15985,4,"star trek : insurrection is the ninth "" star trek "" movie and the third to focus on the "" star trek : the next generation "" crew .",pos
6,cv606,15985,5,"star trek : insurrection qualifies as one of those movies star trek fans , such as myself , would rate somewhere between "" okay "" and "" good . """,pos
6,cv606,15985,6,"after star trek v : the final frontier , a nearly awful movie almost as bad as the repugnant "" star trek : voyager "" tv series , "" star trek "" fans could probably swallow anything paramount throws out in the trek film franchise .",pos
6,cv606,15985,7,i don't wish to spend this review comparing insurrection to the eight other trek movies .,pos
6,cv606,15985,8,"most people reading this probably haven't followed "" star trek "" anyway , so a comparison would seem tedious at best .",pos
6,cv606,15985,9,"let me , thus , make my comparisons briefly so that it's out of my system : star trek : insurrection is not as good as the previous installment , star trek : first contact ; star trek : insurrection's comic tone may be best compared to star trek iv : the voyage home ; star trek ii : the wrath of khan is still the best trek movie .",pos
6,cv606,15985,10,okay . let's move to the movie itself .,pos
6,cv606,15985,11,"star trek : insurrection infuses a basic science fiction premise , humanity's exploration and colonization of space , with a lot of lowbrow humor and witty oneliners .",pos
6,cv606,15985,12,"this combination works well more often than it fails , but when it does fail , the humor really seems cheesy .",pos
6,cv606,15985,13,much of this film appeals to trek fans' nostalgic fondness for the starship enterprise's crew .,pos
6,cv606,15985,14,audiences unfamiliar with trek lore may miss the significance of some plot points and may even become confused at times .,pos
6,cv606,15985,15,star trek : insurrection begins with scenes of the tranquil life on the ba'ku homeworld .,pos
6,cv606,15985,16,"forget the actors and special effects , the beautiful setting of this movie , with its snowy mountaintops and verdant valleys , steals the show .",pos
6,cv606,15985,17,"this tranquility , however , is broken by data , an android , who reveals to the ba'ku that they are being secretly monitored by the federation and their alien allies , the son'a .",pos
6,cv606,15985,18,"it seems that this world is a veritable fountain of youth , sustaining its inhabitants indefinantly in a young , healthy state .",pos
6,cv606,15985,19,"the enterprise crew , led by captain picard , investigates data's actions and uncovers a conspiracy between the son'a and an enterprise admiral to relocate the ba'ku and plunder the planet's youth-restoring properties .",pos
6,cv606,15985,20,sound pretty heavy ?,pos
6,cv606,15985,21,"it is , though this plot , anything but unique and groundbreaking , is undermined by the film's constant barrage of humor .",pos
6,cv606,15985,22,"when going after data , for instance , picard sings an opera piece with him ( this is supposed to be cute and humorous ) .",pos
6,cv606,15985,23,"in a much more funny sequence , work grows a large pimple on the side of his nose as a result of his exposure to the ba'ku homeworld , a pimple which his crewmates , try as they might , cannot avoid looking at .",pos
6,cv606,15985,24,"the acting in star trek : insurrection is , for the most part , pretty good .",pos
6,cv606,15985,25,"since they've been playing these characters for years , those portraying the enterprise crew reassume their roles effortlessly enough .",pos
6,cv606,15985,26,"the terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jean-luc picard and delivers a moral speech , picard's trademark , with his usual aplomb .",pos
6,cv606,15985,27,"brent spiner , another fine actor , plays the android data well enough again and provides the best moments of comic relief in the film ( though the old android-wishing-to-be-human motif will tire some trek fans familiar with the routine from the tv series ) .",pos
6,cv606,15985,28,the supporting cast who appear in this movie alone are also pretty good .,pos
6,cv606,15985,29,"despite many other critics' negative opinions , f . murray abraham ( the winner of an academy award for his performance in amadeus ) plays the major villain ru'afro well enough .",pos
6,cv606,15985,30,"ru'afro reminds me , somewhat , of the baron harkonnen in the 1984 film version of dune .",pos
6,cv606,15985,31,"like the baron , ru'afro continuously has his skin looked after : it is stretched and stapled by servants .",pos
6,cv606,15985,32,"in one particularly memorable scene , ru'afro becomes very agitated , and his facial skin splits open and bleeds .",pos
6,cv606,15985,33,ru'afro is no khan from star trek ii--the best trek villain ever--but he is much better than the forgettable dr . soran from star trek : generations .,pos
6,cv606,15985,34,"( okay , i promise , no more comparisons . )",pos
6,cv606,15985,35,"donna murphy must also be noted as a ba'ku woman , anij , who picard falls in love with .",pos
6,cv606,15985,36,murphy is not a young woman with a supermodel body ; she is a mature woman with an attractive countenance .,pos
6,cv606,15985,37,"this is the type of woman whom picard , for those who know the character well , would be enchanted with .",pos
6,cv606,15985,38,"in fact , the chemistry between murphy and stewart works very well here .",pos
6,cv606,15985,39,"a particular plot point involving anij's ability to slow time down , an ability which she shares with picard , becomes one of the most intriguing parts of the movie .",pos
6,cv606,15985,40,"for as good as the actors and setting were , star trek : insurrection's special effects were surprisingly disappointing .",pos
6,cv606,15985,41,"they proved adequate , sometimes barely , for a 1990s mainstream science fiction film , but they fell way short of the standard trek movie and paled in comparison to those seen in the trailer for star wars : the phantom menace ( a trailer which reportedly preceded many showings of insurrection ) .",pos
6,cv606,15985,42,"the space battles involving the enterprise and sona ships , in particular , seemed trite and unsuspenseful , and the final confrontation between picard and ru'afro took place on a completely unconvincing interior of a satellite .",pos
6,cv606,15985,43,"the new enterprise itself , only seen in this film and its predecessor , remains largely unexplored , though its exterior doesn't look quite right for a reason i cannot explain .",pos
6,cv606,15985,44,"despite star trek : insurrection's frequent comic goofiness and occasional substandard special effects , i enjoyed the film .",pos
6,cv606,15985,45,"it maintains roddenberry's largely optimistic view of the future and rejects the gritty violence of its predecessors , particularly star trek : first contact ( though , don't get me wrong , the dark tones of trek films like first contact can work very successfully ) .",pos
6,cv606,15985,46,"i'd recommend insurrection as a matinee film for a saturday afternoon , especially for fans of trek or science fiction in general .",pos
6,cv606,15985,47,"rated pg , i can't see this film being objectionable to the viewing audience , young or old .",pos
6,cv607,7717,0,"us critic-type people are always shaking our heads and telling everyone that movies aren't thrill rides , but i think that "" back to the future ii "" is one of the few exceptions .",pos
6,cv607,7717,1,"if the original film had the spirit of the 1950s , then this has the spirit of the 80s : full of fights ; chase scenes ; cliff hangers ; special effects ; some detective work ; and of course the vision of the high-tech future .",pos
6,cv607,7717,2,"the film picks up exactly where the first film left off , with doc ( lloyd ) , marty ( fox ) , and jennifer ( elizabeth shue ) travelling 30 years into the future , because something bad is going to happen to marty and jennifer's kids .",pos
6,cv607,7717,3,doc tells marty he must take his son's place at an incident that will cause a chain reaction if marty mcfly jr . says yes to griff ( wilson - in one of four different roles ) .,pos

6,cv607,7717,5,"essentially the same chase scene that marty endured in the 50s takes place again in the year 2015 , but it's not as authentically exciting this time because it is so obviously a parody of itself .",pos

6,cv607,7717,10,"basically we get to see marty as an old man , his house , his family , etc . we also go back to an alternate 1985 , and then back again to 1955 , with everything happening so fast the film never stops to catch a breath .",pos
6,cv607,7717,11,the films' best aspect is the fact that it actually goes back to the first movie and shows a lot of the action that occurred from another angle .,pos
6,cv607,7717,12,it's difficult to convey the sense of wild and zany fun without describing every little detail .,pos
6,cv607,7717,13,the only thing sacrificed in this film is the suspense .,pos

6,cv609,23877,2,"if black & white , the new film from writer/director james toback , is eventually remembered for only one thing , it will be the revelation that brooke shields , claudia schiffer , marla maples and mike tyson can act .",pos
6,cv609,23877,3,"however , this partly improvised gem will be remembered for more than that .",pos
6,cv609,23877,4,black & white is a fascinating film ; it makes a statement about america's youth and hip-hop culture without getting heavy-handed overly serious .,pos
6,cv609,23877,5,"featuring a cast of known commodities ( ben stiller , robert downey jr . ) and hot newcomers ( singers bijou phillips ) , toback's is a complex film worth seeing .",pos

6,cv609,23877,13,"the stories ebb and flow through the film , losing and gaining prominence over time .",pos
6,cv609,23877,14,"friendships are lost , lovers are gained , and there is an occasional burst of violence .",pos
6,cv609,23877,15,"originally rated nc-17 in the united states , black & white features a lot of sex between black gangstas and young white girls .",pos
6,cv609,23877,16,"while the film was trimmed down to a tamer r rating , viewers will wonder what could be more explicit than what they are seeing .",pos
6,cv609,23877,17,"the three-way sexual beginning of the film nicely warns viewers of what they are in for , and several audience members got up and left at that point .",pos
6,cv609,23877,18,the frequent sex is one of the film's few flaws as the titillation is overdone and at times completely unrelated to anything else going on in the film .,pos
6,cv609,23877,19,"to toback's credit , the level of violence in black & white is almost nil .",pos
6,cv609,23877,20,"these gangstas and hip-hop artists are given real problems and concerns , and only become gun-toting crazies when it benefits them to appear that way .",pos
6,cv609,23877,21,"whenever a character finds himself on donager's handheld digital camera , he starts spouting off righteous tirades on america and proclaims his independence , but not everyone has fully bought into the idea .",pos
6,cv609,23877,22,"charlie ( phillips ) is full of bluster about why she loves hip-hop , but admits that "" in ten years time , i'll be way over this . """,pos
6,cv609,23877,23,"these youth know they are going through a phase , and are simply enjoying it .",pos
6,cv609,23877,24,toback fills the spaces between these tirades with scenes that are lightweight and funny .,pos
6,cv609,23877,25,"most of the humour comes from mike tyson , who provides the film's comic relief without really trying .",pos
6,cv609,23877,26,"he is given big words like vernacular to say , and as rich tries to discuss a particular street problem with tyson , he frequently has to ask him to use smaller words and explain himself better , playing on tyson's image as a dimwit .",pos
6,cv609,23877,27,but tyson also gets the film's scariest moment .,pos
6,cv609,23877,28,"as he is mercilessly hit upon by the very gay terry , tyson is a marvel to watch as he fights to remain calm .",pos
6,cv609,23877,29,"the scene is entirely improvised , with downey jr . being told to just keep at tyson until he gets a reaction .",pos
6,cv609,23877,30,"the reaction he gets , being slapped and then choked is astonishing , as downey jr's face turns a frightening shade of purple .",pos
6,cv609,23877,31,"black & white is a film about hip-hop culture , and the film's omnipresent hip-hop soundtrack strongly supports this .",pos
6,cv609,23877,32,"but toback keeps things from becoming too serious ; by moving from story to story as quickly as he does , toback keeps us from becoming attached to any one character's struggle .",pos
6,cv609,23877,33,thus black & white's message about hip-hop becomes secondary to the film itself .,pos
6,cv609,23877,34,toback just wants us to have fun and maybe learn a little about hip-hop along the way .,pos
6,cv609,23877,35,and we do .,pos
6,cv610,2287,0,"one year has passed since the last time we saw them , and but wayne campbell and garth algar are back but , they've moved out of their parents homes , and now have their own pad in an abandoned warehouse .",pos

6,cv610,2287,2,"they guys are just finishing off one of their shows , and head off to an aerosmith concert where they run across cassandra and her new manager , a stereotypical industry slime not unlike the character rob lowe portrayed in the previous film .",pos
6,cv610,2287,3,"again , the promoter is not only after the money that cassandra's talent can bring in .",pos
6,cv610,2287,4,"the storyline quickly degrades to a parallel of the original , "" guy loses chick , guy realizes mistake , and guy gets chick back . """,pos
6,cv610,2287,5,"fortunately , there is more to this movie than this somewhat sheer plot .",pos
6,cv610,2287,6,the wit and humor in this film are surprisingly intelligent and fresh with many inside jokes on the film and music industries as well as just a lot of hilarious scenes of wayne and garth showing their true color .,pos
6,cv610,2287,7,"highlights of the movie include a spoof of jurassic park , garth's seduction by a married woman , a surprise appearance by charleton heston , a 1960's batman setup in the guy's pad , and some pretty groovy chats with jim morrison and some "" naked indian guy , "" an unexpected lip-sync of ymca ( you could see that one coming a mile away ) and of course a hilarious parody of those badly-dubbed kung-fu movies we love to laugh at .",pos
6,cv610,2287,8,"and if you've ever wondered why there's always boxes of watermelons , chickens , and people walking plate glass in the middle of streets , you'll find out here .",pos
6,cv610,2287,9,this movie also explores wayne and garth a little more .,pos
6,cv610,2287,10,"garth has somewhat of a "" coming of age "" and wayne gets to learn a little about himself ( with a little help from our old friend , jim morrison ) .",pos
6,cv610,2287,11,"a few old jokes from the previous movie are explored here again , but this time with a few twists to keep them fresh , and luckily , few , if any of them are overused .",pos
6,cv610,2287,12,"overall , the movie has plenty of continuity flaws ( especially in the fight scent between garth and cassandra's dad ) , but these are easily overlooked as this is , after wayne's world .",pos
6,cv610,2287,13,the plot is flimsy but manageable .,pos
6,cv610,2287,14,"there are a few special effects , but they are fairly seamless , and fill nicely into the plot .",pos
6,cv610,2287,15,"the acting is good , for this sort of movie , but there are some very bright spots .",pos
6,cv610,2287,16,"in the big picture , this movie is just plain fun .",pos
6,cv610,2287,17,there is lots of intelligent humor that makes this film special .,pos
6,cv610,2287,18,"during the whole one hour and 40 minutes , i didn't even think about looking at my watch a single time .",pos
6,cv610,2287,19,"silly , but riotous at times , this is an excellent movie even better than the original .",pos
6,cv611,21120,0,john carpenter directed this stylish and gory vampire flick to which has it's good side and it's bad .,pos
6,cv611,21120,1,it's held up by some good performances and dazzling special effects leading up to an ending that's pretty satisfying .,pos
6,cv611,21120,2,james woods gives an outstanding performance that almost covers up the movie .,pos
6,cv611,21120,3,the good side : some neat scenes of vampires and violence .,pos
6,cv611,21120,4,the bad : no scares .,pos
6,cv611,21120,5,"yes that's right , even though being directed by one of horror's most cherished directors , 'vampires' is the least bit scary , if not at all .",pos
6,cv611,21120,6,james woods stars as jack a vampire hunter out to stop the plans of the 'master' vampire valek played by thomas ian griffith whom wants vampires to walk in the daylight .,pos
6,cv611,21120,7,"daniel baldwin plays his sidekick montoya , a wise-cracking guy who really isn't that funny .",pos

6,cv611,21120,11,"they kill almost all of jack's team , leaving only a few alive .",pos

6,cv611,21120,15,'vampires' definately could have been done better .,pos
6,cv611,21120,16,"the make-up , special effects and story are first rate , but there is no scares or terror that the film could have had .",pos
6,cv611,21120,17,"it to me had more humor than horror , almost being compared to 'fright night' with the mix of violence and comedy .",pos
6,cv611,21120,18,john carpenter does a great job of directing this film .,pos
6,cv611,21120,19,"he eases through some tough times and saves the flaws , which are noticeable but forgettable .",pos
6,cv611,21120,20,"the script is clever and funny , with many lines that make us laugh out loud .",pos
6,cv611,21120,21,i much enjoyed 'vampires' with a few exceptions .,pos
6,cv611,21120,22,it's one of those films you see but don't take to heart .,pos
6,cv611,21120,23,you enjoy the time you spent and go on .,pos
6,cv611,21120,24,"the recently released 'psycho' is the same way , it's not as good as you'd hope but it is fun and entertaining .",pos
6,cv611,21120,25,'vampires' is a good horror flick with no scares but plenty of other content to please the viewer .,pos
6,cv612,5461,0,"in the wake of the smashing success of "" rumble in the bronx , "" it's looking more and more likely that more jackie chan films will see american release .",pos
6,cv612,5461,1,rumor has it that one of these films will be drunken master ii .,pos
6,cv612,5461,2,"the version i have is a copy from the laserdisc ; it's widescreen and bilingually-subtitled , as are most hong kong films these days .",pos
6,cv612,5461,3,availability over here in the united states is very limited ; these films must either be purchased via pirates or sought out from asian distributors such as tai seng .,pos
6,cv612,5461,4,the subtitling on the copy i have is slightly hard to read ; the letters are white and a bit small .,pos
6,cv612,5461,5,"although the american release will almost certainly be dubbed , this review is of the subtitled version , so please keep that in mind if you're reading this review to help you decide whether to go out and see it .",pos
6,cv612,5461,6,"to be fair , i must admit that i've never been very fond of "" period-piece "" martial arts movies--the ones set in some nebulous china of the distant or not so distant past .",pos
6,cv612,5461,7,"perhaps it's because most of those i've seen were filmed on inferior stock , with either butchered dubbing or all-but-illegible subtitling , or perhaps it's because their plots all tend to be very similar to each other and , in many cases , all but nonexistant .",pos
6,cv612,5461,8,"in fact , many of them get so wrapped up in their subplots that they seem to forget their main plot entirely until only a few minutes before the end .",pos
6,cv612,5461,9,"or , for that matter , it might be because the jackie chan films with more modern settings ( armour of god , rumble in the bronx , etc . ) tend to have more spectacular stunts , often involving large motor vehicles and large explosions , whereas period pieces simply have the martial arts .",pos
6,cv612,5461,10,"having said that , i must now turn right around and say that drunken master ii is a remarkable exception to all or most of the above , is one of the better martial arts films i've seen , and i quite enjoyed it .",pos
6,cv612,5461,11,surprised ?,pos
6,cv612,5461,12,"well , so was i .",pos
6,cv612,5461,13,drunken master ii is about a young man named wong fei-hong ( played by jackie chan ) who is a master of the drunken boxing style of kung fu .,pos
6,cv612,5461,14,"where he learned this style is uncertain , as his father , wong kei-ying ( ti lung ) is steadfast in his opposition to fei-hong's practicing it rather than some more normal style of kung fu .",pos
6,cv612,5461,15,"apparently , fei-hong is some sort of figure from chinese folklore , rather like paul bunyan is for americans , but i've heard very little about this , and could quite well be wrong , so i'll leave analysis of that to the people who know it better .",pos
6,cv612,5461,16,"one of my friends points out that the character of wong fei-hong is also featured in the "" once upon a time in china "" movies , but i have not yet seen those .",pos
6,cv612,5461,17,"the plot of drunken master ii is somewhat hazy , as are the plots to many such films , but if you're watching a jackie chan film , odds are you aren't expecting something on the order of "" war and peace "" .",pos
6,cv612,5461,18,"the story seems to revolve around those evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chinese relics ( and hence , china's cultural heritage ) while overworking , underpaying , and beating up chinese workers in a nearby steel mill .",pos
6,cv612,5461,19,"however , this plot merely serves as a framework for the other main story of the film--fei-hong's perpetual struggle to win his girlfriend , supplicate his father , keep his ( pregnant ) mother ( played by anita mui ) from fighting , and keep from getting beaten up by evil foreigner thugs .",pos
6,cv612,5461,20,the macguffin that drives the plot ( s ) is a precious antique jade imperial seal which is being taken away by the evil foreigners .,pos
6,cv612,5461,21,"in the beginning , fei-hong accidentally steals it while trying to recover an identically-wrapped box containing the medicinal ginseng his father was bringing back for a customer .",pos
6,cv612,5461,22,"in the process , he clashes with another thief , who is himself trying for the seal but ends up instead with the ginseng .",pos
6,cv612,5461,23,"after fei-hong narrowly avoids getting caught with the seal by the evil foreigners' lackies , thanks to some timely intervention by a general's son ( a cameo appearance by andy lau , who would later take on the starring role in drunken master iii ! ) , comedic chaos ensues back at the wong household when fei-hong and his mother attempt to come up with a replacement for the missing ginseng .",pos
6,cv612,5461,24,and so it goes .,pos
6,cv612,5461,25,"and the plot thickens later on , such as when fei-hong's girlfriend maneuvers him into a kung fu match with a rival , or when fei-hong and the thief , now revealed to be a loyalist manchu officer trying to recover the seal and stop the evil foreigners , are attacked en masse ( another grand kung-fu movie tradition ) , but i think i've already spent more time on the plot than it really deserves .",pos
6,cv612,5461,26,let's move on to the real draw of jackie chan movies . . . the,pos
6,cv612,5461,27,action .,pos
6,cv612,5461,28,there's plenty of martial arts action to be found in this movie . . . of,pos
6,cv612,5461,29,"course , in a kung fu film , that's to be expected .",pos
6,cv612,5461,30,"however , this isn't just another kung fu movie ; this one has jackie chan doing the fight and stunt choreography , and jackie chan is a genius .",pos
6,cv612,5461,31,"the primary martial arts "" style "" featured in the film is drunken boxing , a form of kung fu which attempts to draw the adversary off his guard by making it seem like the fellow using it is drunk .",pos
6,cv612,5461,32,"further , for the purposes of this film at least , drunken boxers fight better when they actually _are_ intoxicated . . . but",pos
6,cv612,5461,33,there's a fine line between just drunk enough and drunk into a stupor .,pos
6,cv612,5461,34,"under normal circumstances , the idea of someone staggering around looking sloshed but managing to fight effectively and even incredibly might seem rather stupid , but jackie pulls it off with flair .",pos
6,cv612,5461,35,"the kung fu sequences are so intricate in their staging and execution that it is pointless to try to describe it on paper , so i'll just say that the fights--especially the big climactic fight at the end--in themselves make the movie worth watching .",pos
6,cv612,5461,36,another thing drunken master ii has going for it is the stunt work .,pos
6,cv612,5461,37,"even without motor vehicles ( well , not counting a train ) , there are some remarkable stunts in this film .",pos
6,cv612,5461,38,"among other things , jackie dives off a balcony into a table and crawls across hot coals ( not once , but at _least_ twice , if you count the outtake shown during the credits ) .",pos
6,cv612,5461,39,( quicktime movies of these stunts can be found through the www movie database . ),pos
6,cv612,5461,40,"unlike in american films , these stunts are _not_ faked .",pos
6,cv612,5461,41,"drunken master ii stars several veteran actors of the hong kong movie scene , including jackie , ti lung ( "" a better tomorrow "" 1 & 2 ) , and anita mui ( the "" heroic trio "" series , "" rumble in the bronx "" ) .",pos
6,cv612,5461,42,"the performances are first-rate , especially when it comes to the comedy parts of the film .",pos
6,cv612,5461,43,"the scene where fei-hong and his mother conspire literally behind fei-hong's father's back to cover up for the missing ginseng root is hilarious , as is the scene where fei-hong's mother , having just revealed that she is pregnant , is threatening to hurt herself ( in order to draw her husband's anger away from fei-hong ) .",pos
6,cv612,5461,44,"jackie has developed his knack for physical comedy into a sort of mastery over the years , and he's in fine form all through drunken master ii .",pos
6,cv612,5461,45,"as far as cinematography is concerned , it certainly works for this film .",pos
6,cv612,5461,46,"it's nothing spectacular , but is at least a dozen times better than all those old kung fu movies of the 70s .",pos
6,cv612,5461,47,the picture is crisp and clear .,pos
6,cv612,5461,48,"one thing i find particularly worthy of mention is that , at least in the copy i have , the screen was wider than any film i've ever seen on videotape before--almost a whole 1/3 of the screen was blocked out above and below .",pos
6,cv612,5461,49,( watch this on a bigscreen tv or movie theater if you can . ),pos
6,cv612,5461,50,it will be an utter shame if this film is eventually pan-and-scanned for american video release .,pos
6,cv612,5461,51,"drunken master ii shows the full potential of "" period piece "" kung fu movies , and it's good enough to overcome even my usual distaste for such movies .",pos
6,cv612,5461,52,"the plot does meander a bit , but that's to be expected in this type of film .",pos
6,cv612,5461,53,"if you like this kind of movie , you'll love this movie , and if not , well , give it a chance anyway .",pos
