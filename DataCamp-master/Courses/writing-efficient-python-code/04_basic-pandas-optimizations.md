## Basic pandas optimizations

This chapter offers a brief introduction on how to efficiently work with pandas DataFrames. You'll learn the various options you have for iterating over a DataFrame. Then, you'll learn how to efficiently apply functions to data stored in a DataFrame.

### Iterating with .iterrows()

```
# Iterate over pit_df and print each row
for i,row in pit_df.iterrows():
    print(row)

# Iterate over pit_df and print each index variable and then each row
for i,row in pit_df.iterrows():
    print(i)
    print(row)
    print(type(row))

# Use one variable instead of two to store the result of .iterrows()
for row_tuple in pit_df.iterrows():
    print(row_tuple)

# Print the row and type of each row
for row_tuple in pit_df.iterrows():
    print(row_tuple)
    print(type(row_tuple))
```

### Run differentials with .iterrows()

```
# Create an empty list to store run differentials
run_diffs = []

# Write a for loop and collect runs allowed and runs scored for each row
for i,row in giants_df.iterrows():
    runs_scored = row['RS']
    runs_allowed = row['RA']
    
    # Use the provided function to calculate run_diff for each row
    run_diff = calc_run_diff(runs_scored, runs_allowed)
    
    # Append each run differential to the output list
    run_diffs.append(run_diff)

giants_df['RD'] = run_diffs
print(giants_df)
```

### Iterating with .itertuples()

```
# Loop over the DataFrame and print each row
for row in rangers_df.itertuples():
  print(row)


# Loop over the DataFrame and print each row's Index, Year and Wins (W)
for row in rangers_df.itertuples():
  i = row.Index
  year = row.Year
  wins = row.W
  
  # Check if rangers made Playoffs (1 means yes; 0 means no)
  if row.Playoffs == 1:
    print(i, year, wins)
```

### Run differentials with .itertuples()

```
run_diffs = []

# Loop over the DataFrame and calculate each row's run differential
for row in yankees_df.itertuples():
    
    runs_scored = row.RS
    runs_allowed = row.RA

    run_diff = calc_run_diff(runs_scored, runs_allowed)
    
    run_diffs.append(run_diff)

# Append new column
yankees_df['RD'] = run_diffs
print(yankees_df)
```

### Analyzing baseball stats with .apply()

```
# Gather sum of all columns
stat_totals = rays_df.sum(axis=0)
print(stat_totals)

# Gather total runs scored in all games per year
total_runs_scored = rays_df[['RS', 'RA']].sum(axis=1)
print(total_runs_scored)

# Convert numeric playoffs to text by applying text_playoffs()
textual_playoffs = rays_df.apply(lambda row: text_playoffs(row['Playoffs']), axis=1)
print(textual_playoffs)
```

### Settle a debate with .apply()

```
# Display the first five rows of the DataFrame
print(dbacks_df.head())

# Create a win percentage Series 
win_percs = dbacks_df.apply(lambda row: calc_win_perc(row['W'], row['G']), axis=1)
print(win_percs, '\n')

# Append a new column to dbacks_df
dbacks_df['WP'] = win_percs
print(dbacks_df, '\n')

# Display dbacks_df where WP is greater than 0.50
print(dbacks_df[dbacks_df['WP'] >= 0.50])
```

### Replacing .iloc with underlying arrays

```
# Use the W array and G array to calculate win percentages
win_percs_np = calc_win_perc(baseball_df['W'].values, baseball_df['G'].values)

# Append a new column to baseball_df that stores all win percentages
baseball_df['WP'] = win_percs_np

print(baseball_df.head())
```

### Bringing it all together: Predict win percentage

```
win_perc_preds_loop = []

# Use a loop and .itertuples() to collect each row's predicted win percentage
for row in baseball_df.itertuples():
    runs_scored = row.RS
    runs_allowed = row.RA
    win_perc_pred = predict_win_perc(runs_scored, runs_allowed)
    win_perc_preds_loop.append(win_perc_pred)

# Apply predict_win_perc to each row of the DataFrame
win_perc_preds_apply = baseball_df.apply(lambda row: predict_win_perc(row['RS'], row['RA']), axis=1)

# Calculate the win percentage predictions using NumPy arrays
win_perc_preds_np = predict_win_perc(baseball_df['RS'].values, baseball_df['RA'].values)
baseball_df['WP_preds'] = win_perc_preds_np
print(baseball_df.head())
```
