## [Model Tuning](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/machine-learning-with-tree-based-models-in-python/model-tuning)

The hyperparameters of a machine learning model are parameters that are not learned from data. They should be set prior to fitting the model to the training set. In this chapter, you'll learn how to tune the hyperparameters of a tree-based model using grid search cross validation.
