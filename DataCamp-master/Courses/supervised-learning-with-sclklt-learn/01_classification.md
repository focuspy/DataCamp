## Classification

In this chapter, you will be introduced to classification problems and learn how to solve them using supervised learning techniques. And you’ll apply what you learn to a political dataset, where you classify the party affiliation of United States congressmen based on their voting records.

### [k-Nearest Neighbors: Fit](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/supervised-learning-with-scikit-learn/classification?ex=7)

```

# Import KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn.neighbors
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier 

# Create arrays for the features and the response variable
y = df['party'].values
X = df.drop('party', axis=1).values

# Create a k-NN classifier with 6 neighbors
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=6)

# Fit the classifier to the data
knn.fit(X, y)
```

### [k-Nearest Neighbors: Fit](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/supervised-learning-with-scikit-learn/classification?ex=8)

```

# Import KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn.neighbors
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier 

# Create arrays for the features and the response variable
y = df['party'].values
X = df.drop('party', axis=1).values

# Create a k-NN classifier with 6 neighbors: knn
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=6)

# Fit the classifier to the data
knn.fit(X, y)

# Predict the labels for the training data X: y_pred
y_pred = knn.predict(X)

# Predict and print the label for the new data point X_new
new_prediction = knn.predict(X_new)
print("Prediction: {}".format(new_prediction))
