## Fine-tuning your model

Having trained your model, your next task is to evaluate its performance. In this chapter, you will learn about some of the other metrics available in scikit-learn that will allow you to assess your model's performance in a more nuanced manner. Next, learn to optimize your classification and regression models using hyperparameter tuning.

## [Metrics for classification](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/supervised-learning-with-scikit-learn/fine-tuning-your-model?ex=2)

```

# Import necessary modules
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

# Create training and test set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.4, random_state=42)

# Instantiate a k-NN classifier: knn
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=6)

# Fit the classifier to the training data
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict the labels of the test data: y_pred
y_pred = knn.predict(X_test)

# Generate the confusion matrix and classification report
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

## [# Building a logistic regression model](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/supervised-learning-with-scikit-learn/fine-tuning-your-model?ex=4)

```

# Import the necessary modules
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report

# Create training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.4, random_state=42)

# Create the classifier: logreg
logreg = LogisticRegression()

# Fit the classifier to the training data
logreg.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict the labels of the test set: y_pred
y_pred = logreg.predict(X_test)

# Compute and print the confusion matrix and classification report
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
