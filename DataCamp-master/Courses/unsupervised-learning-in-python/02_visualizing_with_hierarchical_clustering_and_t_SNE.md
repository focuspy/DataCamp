## [Visualization with hierarchical clustering and t-SNE](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/unsupervised-learning-in-python/visualization-with-hierarchical-clustering-and-t-sne)

In this chapter, you'll learn about two unsupervised learning techniques for data visualization, hierarchical clustering and t-SNE. Hierarchical clustering merges the data samples into ever-coarser clusters, yielding a tree visualization of the resulting cluster hierarchy. t-SNE maps the data samples into 2d space so that the proximity of the samples to one another can be visualized.
