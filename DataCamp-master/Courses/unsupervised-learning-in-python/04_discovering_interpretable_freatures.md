## [Discovering interpretable features](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/unsupervised-learning-in-python/discovering-interpretable-features?ex=1)

In this chapter, you'll learn about a dimension reduction technique called "Non-negative matrix factorization" ("NMF") that expresses samples as combinations of interpretable parts. For example, it expresses documents as combinations of topics, and images in terms of commonly occurring visual patterns. You'll also learn to use NMF to build recommender systems that can find you similar articles to read, or musical artists that match your listening history!
