## [Decorrelating your data and dimension reduction](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/unsupervised-learning-in-python/decorrelating-your-data-and-dimension-reduction)

Dimension reduction summarizes a dataset using its common occuring patterns. In this chapter, you'll learn about the most fundamental of dimension reduction techniques, "Principal Component Analysis" ("PCA"). PCA is often used before supervised learning to improve model performance and generalization. It can also be useful for unsupervised learning. For example, you'll employ a variant of PCA will allow you to cluster Wikipedia articles by their content!
