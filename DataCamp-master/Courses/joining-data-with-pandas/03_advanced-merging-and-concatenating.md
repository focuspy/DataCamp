## [Advanced Merging and Concatenating](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/joining-data-with-pandas/advanced-merging-and-concatenating) 

In this chapter, you’ll leverage powerful filtering techniques, including semi-joins and anti-joins. You’ll also learn how to glue DataFrames by vertically combining and using the pandas.concat function to create new datasets. Finally, because data is rarely clean, you’ll also learn how to validate your newly combined data structures.
