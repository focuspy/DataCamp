## [Hierarchical Clustering](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/cluster-analysis-in-python/hierarchical-clustering-877595ec-58cd-4cf5-837c-704a42eb8776)

This chapter focuses on a popular clustering algorithm - hierarchical clustering - and its implementation in SciPy. In addition to the procedure to perform hierarchical clustering, it attempts to help you answer an important question - how many clusters are present in your data? The chapter concludes with a discussion on the limitations of hierarchical clustering and discusses considerations while using hierarchical clustering.
